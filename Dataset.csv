"The aim of this article is to explore implications of globalization for adolescent cultural identity formation. The thesis is that adolescents increasingly form multicultural identities because they grow up knowing diverse cultural beliefs and behaviors. First, ways that adolescents increasingly have exposure to different cultures are illustrated with ethnographic and cross-cultural work. Then, 3 emerging research issues are raised: (a) the extent to which it is important whether a multicultural identity is based on first-hand versus indirect (media-based) interactions with diverse peoples, (b) how cultural identity formation may take diverse developmental paths depending on the particular cultures involved, and (c) gains and losses that occur when persons form a multicultural identity rather than an identity based primarily on one cultural tradition. Finally, the article suggests using multiple methods that are sensitive to different perspectives in research on globalization and adolescent identity formation.

"Poetry evokes emotions. It does so, according to the theory we present, from three sorts of simulation. They each can prompt emotions, which are communications both within the brain and among people. First, models of a poem's semantic contents can evoke emotions as do models that occur in depictions of all kinds, from novels to perceptions. Second, mimetic simulations of prosodic cues, such as meter, rhythm, and rhyme, yield particular emotional states. Third, people's simulations of themselves enable them to know that they are engaged with a poem, and an aesthetic emotion can occur as a result. The three simulations predict certain sorts of emotion, e.g., prosodic cues can evoke basic emotions of happiness, sadness, anger, and anxiety. Empirical evidence corroborates the theory, which we relate to other accounts of poetic emotions.

"Ideologies can be traced back and extracted through formal aspect of language where the authors’ choices reflect the world view they construct in order to influence their receptors. This study aims at extracting ideologies of war in war poetry relying upon the model of critical stylistics proposed by Leslie Jeffries (2010). The model presents ten textual-conceptual tools of analysis; one of which, ‘negating’, has been adopted as a tool of analysis in this paper to extract the hidden ideologies. The study came to the conclusion that the textual conceptual tool of analysis, negating, as a formal textual aspect guides into manifesting the hidden ideologies of the text producer about war and this is achieved through creating a virtual positive world in receptor’s mind to be juxtaposed with the actual negated world in order to build expectations.

"The many advantages of reading digitally also bring with them implications for how we learn differently when we read differently. The author suggests that new contemporary technologies are changing the very notion of what it means to read. Even millennials acknowledge that their attention is more focused when they read print rather than online. But they also perceive print as boring. If print is increasingly seen as more boring than digital text, will our ability to read print generally diminish? Since online technology is tailor-made for searching for information rather than analyzing complex ideas, might the meaning of “reading” become finding information rather than contemplating and understanding?

"Using plastic as a “theory machine,” this article looks into the dynamics and poetics of what I call plastic literature. It argues out a case for the “plastic sea” with its properties like sinking, mineralization, scopious contamination, pervasiveness, and deep-water micro-plasticization. The translocationality of plastic represents a spatial consciousness where plastic seeps into salt, water, soil, animal and human bodies, media, and our psychosis in non-linear, non-hierarchical, fragmentary mobility and fluidity; this does not discriminate between its point of origin and eventual destination, race, ethnicities, discriminations of colour, religious affiliations, cultural heritage, and political schoolings. Thus, plastic provokes connections/comparatism with a difference that speaks of becomings, dispersions, and immanence. Is plastic behaviour and agency not close to how we think of literature in a globalized world? Working out the other areas of the material aesthetic of plastic, the article connects plastic behaviour with literary habits and thinking. It homes in on “plastic lit(t)erization” to bring about a new poetics of thinking and doing literature. The article strings corresponding coordinates as made available through our understanding of plastic sea, networks of transmission, travel and transition, gradient flow, trans-corporeality, local-global fusion, process time, sink, and the discourses around hyper sea. Plastic literature becomes our new poetics of generating literary capital and rethinking world literature.

Out of Giddens’ (1990) emphasis on modernity and Robertson's (1992) on globality emerges the need to conceptualize globalization in relation to the social per se. An exemplificatory conceptual case study points to global processes straining older concepts formed for nation state sociologies:deterrtorialization of the community concept results in the imagined community; global culture signals the fragmentation of the culture concept; ‘milieu ‘ has to be extended and generalized for global relevance. Globalization makes the structuration of new forms and types of groups and social relationships a key conceptual problem for sociology. But its impact also highlights the generative processes for new sociological concepts,non-technical,-,
"Today globalization is constant and even irreversible. Globalization influences to changing cultural patterns too. In addition, there is happening a mutual penetration of various trends in art and their exchange. Globalization describes the acceleration of the integration of nations into the global system. It contributes to the expansion of cultural ties between the peoples and human migration. But there is a disadvantage too. Preferring a unified type of art, unfortunately, is sometimes forgotten their own culture. Young people no longer take an interest to own culture. In addition, less attention is paid to the development of the art of the country in its own unique way. Art also begins to serve the interests of the economic market. In connection with this, it becomes important to study the interaction processes of globalization and culture.

"Empowered youth CAN and DO make a difference!

Young people become empowered by their participation in the institutions and decisions that affect their lives—which in turn can lead to real positive change in the community. Youth Participation and Community Change presents leading authorities providing the latest research and effective approaches on how young people can be drawn to participate in organizations and communities. The diverse perspectives discuss youth participation in today’s society, the models and methods of its practice, the roles of youth and adults, and the future of youth participation and community in a diverse democracy. Approaches include those which promote participatory community-based research and evaluation, and involve youth groups in poor and racially segregated areas.

The mainstream view of much of today’s youth is that of being victims of society rather than a being a possible positive influence on society as a whole. Youth Participation and Community Change seeks to shift the viewpoint from youth as being problems to empowering them to enact positive social change. The book explores community agency efforts to involve young people, and the process by which youth civic engagement promotes empowerment. Social work and public health approaches are examined, with cogent discussions on conceptual and theoretical issues. Empirically based case studies illustrate best practices and interdisciplinary work that draws upon psychology, sociology, social work, public health, education, and related academic disciplines and professional fields.

Topics in Youth Participation and Community Change include:
	•	key dimensions of critical youth empowerment
	•	a case study of youth leadership development in Hawaii—the Sariling Gawa Youth Council
	•	the Lexington Youth Leadership Academy—a leadership development and community change program
	•	a new model for youth civic engagement in Hampton, Virginia
	•	three projects that engage urban youth in community change through participatory research
	•	youth engagement strategies and the benefits of youth participation in health research
	•	ten projects which used photovoice to represent, advocate, and enhance community health 
	•	a participatory action research process with youth in Bosnia and Herzegovina
	•	the Growing Up in Cities project of UNESCO
	•	training students as facilitators for the Youth Empowerment Strategies (YES!) project
	•	four characteristics of engagement in the research literature and a school-community-university project
	•	differences in developmental outcomes among youth organizing, identity-support, and traditional youth development agencies

Youth Participation and Community Change is thought-provoking, enlightening reading that is perfect for organizers, planners, policymakers, advocates, youth service workers, agency administrators, educators, students, and professionals in psychology, sociology, social work, urban planning, public policy, and public health.",non-technical,-,
"This revised edition of a now classic text includes a new introduction by Henry Jenkins, explaining ‘Why Fiske Still Matters’ for today’s students, followed by a discussion between former Fiske students Kevin Glynn, Jonathan Gray, and Pamela Wilson on the theme of ‘Reading Fiske and Understanding the Popular’. Both underline the continuing relevance of this foundational text in the study of popular culture.
What is popular culture? How does it differ from mass culture? And what do popular ""texts"" reveal about class, race, and gender dynamics in a society? John Fiske answers these and a host of other questions in Understanding Popular Culture.
When it was first written, Understanding Popular Culture took a groundbreaking approach to studying such cultural artifacts as jeans, shopping malls, tabloid newspapers, and TV game shows, which remains relevant today. Fiske differentiates between mass culture – the cultural ""products"" put out by an industrialized, capitalist society – and popular culture – the ways in which people use, abuse, and subvert these products to create their own meanings and messages. Rather than focusing on mass culture’s attempts to dominate and homogenize, he prefers to look at (and revel in) popular culture’s evasions and manipulations of these attempts.
Designed as a companion to Reading the Popular, Understanding Popular Culture presents a radically different theory of what it means for culture to be popular: that it is, literally, of the people. It is not imposed on them, it is created by them, and its pleasures and meanings reflect popular tastes and concerns – and a rejection of those fostered by mass culture. With wit, clarity, and insight, Professor Fiske debunks the myth of the mindless mass audience, and demonstrates that, in myriad ways, popular culture thrives because that audience is more aware than anyone guesses",non-technical,-,
"Objective
This article reviews the literature concerning the impact of exposure to domestic violence on the health and developmental well-being of children and young people. Impact is explored across four separate yet inter-related domains (domestic violence exposure and child abuse; impact on parental capacity; impact on child and adolescent development; and exposure to additional adversities), with potential outcomes and key messages concerning best practice responses to children's needs highlighted.
Method
A comprehensive search of identified databases was conducted within an 11-year framework (1995–2006). This yielded a vast literature which was selectively organized and analyzed according to the four domains identified above.
Results
This review finds that children and adolescents living with domestic violence are at increased risk of experiencing emotional, physical and sexual abuse, of developing emotional and behavioral problems and of increased exposure to the presence of other adversities in their lives. It also highlights a range of protective factors that can mitigate against this impact, in particular a strong relationship with and attachment to a caring adult, usually the mother.
Conclusion
Children and young people may be significantly affected by living with domestic violence, and impact can endure even after measures have been taken to secure their safety. It also concludes that there is rarely a direct causal pathway leading to a particular outcome and that children are active in constructing their own social world. Implications for interventions suggest that timely, appropriate and individually tailored responses need to build on the resilient blocks in the child's life.

"Migration is a phenomenon that has global, regional, and local significance in many areas, such as: development, politics, social relations, labour, humanitarian issues, the legal framework, security, and education. Globally, the number of migrants is increasing from year to year, and migration reasons are often very different. They have always been generated by push and pull factors that have affected individuals, entire groups of peoples, states, regions, and international organizations. We can conclude that there is no part or segment of human activity that is not more or less affected by the phenomenon of migration. Therefore, this analysis aims to investigate through a binary case study of Croatia and Indonesia to explore to what extent the migration phenomenon is present at all universities in Croatia (total 12) and an equal number of universities from different parts of Indonesia. The final result we want to achieve is to compare and contrast the migration education provided by the universities from both countries.",non-technical,-,
"The participation of women in agriculture and the role of women in society in the preindustrial period were remarkably different across ethnicities and strongly related to the type of agricultural technology adopted historically. The sexual division of labor was broadly associated to two technological regimes: shifting cultivation, where the majority of agricultural work was done by women, and plough cultivation, a system mostly dominated by men. In this article, we review the literature on the persistent effect of the impact of historical plough use on female labor force participation and fertility today. We also provide additional evidence showing that differences regarding the role of women across the two agricultural regimes were more general and persisted over time in other societal aspects, including the form of marital arrangements, the presence of polygamy and the freedom of movement enjoyed by women.

"One of the most interesting features of the study of religion in recent years has been the resurgence of interest in its relationship with the political world. Many scholars now recognize that earlier assumptions, at least in Western academic circles, about the fading of religion from political life have not been borne out (Westerlund 1996; Sahliyeh 1990). To the contrary, instead of a gradual marginalization and privatization of religion, in many parts of the world the opposite has occurred. Even in the West, religion has retained or even reasserted its presence in public debate, not least in the United States.

"Throughout the evolutionary track of human, the evolution or extinction of both ancient and modern civilizations are characterized by processes like growth, assimilation, invasion, aggression, and annihilation. How did human civilizations evolve through wars and assimilations as envisaged in history? Here we perform a set of simple in silico experiments in two space dimensions where different group of domains (civilizations) each of different sizes are allowed to evolve through interactions (wars) and coalescences from their initial random distribution. As they grow in size, domains of similar group undergo coalescence when they meet while domains belonging to different group engage in warfare at the point of interaction. During a warfare, the smaller domain is annihilated and the larger domain shrinks in size depending upon the fairness of the war. As a result, we obtain varying decay rate and age-size distribution of civilizations under different conditions and they are found to depend on the fairness of war, initial distributions, number of distinct groups, and initial number density. We also investigate the impact of war in the presence of powerful civilizations that never retreats in a war. By tuning the critical size for an autonomous civilization, we show in accordance with the historical fact that the primitive period is quite longer with a very high frequency of war than the post-primitive period that starts from the very beginning of the autonomous civilization. We discuss several issues related to the extinction and persistence of civilizations in the light of some existing historical data.

"Cartography has historically been a weapon of colonists used to demarcate land stolen by empire. More recently, however, ‘critical cartographies’ have emerged as a means of critiquing colonial discourses, revealing maps as representations of the dominating ideologies that produce them. This article explores a series of ongoing questions raised by our own work seeking to map the intersection of colonial and Indigenous governance regimes in so-called Australia. As a visualisation of the intense intervention into Indigenous lives by the settler state, this map tells a story of colonial extraction and elimination, as well as of Indigenous survival, thriving, resistance and resurgence, “denaturalis[ing]” settler geographies of power to contextualise current tensions in governance relations within a continuing history of colonisation (Razack, 2018). Drawing on Indigenous critical theory and the Latourian concept of the immutable mobile (1986) as a way of naming the apparatus that operationalises colonial mapping, we explore the ethical and political dynamics of critical cartography, characterised by a tension between reinscribing and undoing colonial power. We argue that, in navigating and attempting to foreground these tensions, our mapping project has value in its visual inversion of conventional representations of sovereignty. It reveals the fragility, incompleteness, and material violence of colonial sovereignty, which is so often understood as neutral and inevitable. It maps this colonial project in relation to and as rendered impossible by the endurance of Indigenous sovereignty. Against the colonial imagining of Indigenous sovereignty as fragile, disappearing and mutable, it resituates this sovereignty as inhering in the land and in Indigenous peoples as “resilient existent” and as the true immutable (Moreton-Robinson, 2021, p. 258).

"On one level, history is used by all parts of the International Relations (IR) discipline. But lurking beneath the surface of IR’s approach to history lies a well-entrenched binary. Whereas mainstream positions use history as a means to fill in their theoretical frames (seeing history as a kind of ‘scripture’ of abstract lessons), many post-positivists reduce history to a pick-and-mix of contingent hiccups (a ‘butterfly’ of what-ifs and maybes). Interestingly enough, this binary is one reproduced throughout the social sciences. As such, there is a bigger story to the apparently ‘eternal divide’ between history and social science than first meets the eye. This article uses the various ways in which history is used — and abused — in IR to probe more deeply into the relationship between history and social science as a whole. This exploration reveals four frameworks, two drawn from history (context and narrative) and two drawn from social science (eventfulness and ideal-typification) which illustrate the necessary co-implication of the two enterprises. The article employs these tools as a means of re-imagining the relationship between history and social science (including IR), conceiving this as a single intellectual journey in which both are permanently in view.",non-technical,-,
"Ancient religions can be defined as the religions of Mediterranean antiquity, with important connections to the neighboring Ancient Near East. While different approaches to these religions formed throughout European intellectual history, proper academic theories and methods of their study started to emerge in the nineteenth century, with a proliferation of new approaches beginning with the 1990s. Historical approaches reconstruct the development of religions through time and discuss the problems of such reconstructions. Textual criticism studies manuscript traditions and attempts to reconstruct the original text. Various philological methods developed and used especially in biblical studies include the analysis of written and oral sources behind the text, the examination of editorial processes, and reasoning about the original context of the text. Archaeology studies built structures and artifacts from antiquity, employs a variety of dating methods, connects artifacts to social, economic, and environmental conditions, and explores the size, distribution and interconnectedness of archaeological sites. Texts and artifacts might tell different stories and interpretation is needed to gain information from both types of historical evidence. Literary theory approaches texts as finished artifacts instead of looking at the history behind the text. Text-centered approaches include rhetorical, narrative, and typological analysis. Reader-response criticism emphasizes the role of the reader in establishing the meaning of the text. Psychological approaches include traditional psychoanalysis and depth-psychology, as well as historical psychology that uses insights and models from contemporary personality psychology and social psychology. Among social scientific approaches, memory studies look at the formation of textual traditions, including oral composition, transmission, and performance. Models of cultural memory also gained currency. Sociology, social history, and economic history shed light on the socioeconomic background of ancient religions. Religious studies had an intimate connection with anthropology especially in its early period, while models borrowed from cultural and structural anthropology influenced the study of Mediterranean values and social interactions more recently. Gender studies and feminist approaches initially focused on the reinterpretation of women’s roles in ancient religions and especially since the 1990s they addressed gender as a socially constructed category. Work on voluntary associations in the Greco-Roman world sheds light on the social context of private cults. Among new developments, postcolonial criticism both examines the colonial history of ancient cultures and addresses the colonial origins and inclinations of scholarship on religious antiquity. The approach of lived religion focusses on how individuals experience religion in their everyday lives. Cognitive science approaches study the evolutionary and psychological foundations of ancient religious thought and behavior, drawing especially on insights from neuroscience, experimental psychology, and evolutionary theory. Ritual studies employ models of individual and collective ritual behavior to understand cultic practices in religious antiquity. New approaches to magic move beyond cultural constructivism and use the concept as an analytical tool to understand a set of behaviors and attitudes. Insights from cognitive neuroscience have been applied to the study of religious experience. Cultural evolutionary theory has been employed to explain the success of particular religious movements and the development of oral and written traditions. Digital humanities include the computer-assisted collection and analysis of historical evidence and computer modeling tools, such as agent-based models. Finally, network science sheds new light on geographical, social, and textual patterns and dynamics in ancient religions.",non-technical,-,

The first study reports on the free recall of persons (relatives, friends, acquaintances) and compares the data with potential changes in social contingencies in the life of college subjects. In the second study, college students recollect the names of historical figures (politicians, scientists, artists). These data are compared with interpretations of the course of political intellectual history. In the third study, a report (recall) of the history of psychology by one eminent historian of the behavioral sciences, Professor Boring, is analyzed and the results compared with those of the first two studies.

"Over the past few decades, many dimensions of social life that once remained at least partly outside the structure of the market have now been incorporated substantially into it. The mass media are among the most important of those social institutions which have been subject to ‘enclosure’ by the logic of the market in the Age of Neoliberalism. It is common today to build the story of recent social change, and in particular to discuss change in media institutions over the past generation, in terms of the shift to neoliberalism. All too often, however, this way of telling the story of media and social change rests content with vague and simplistic formulations which, I will argue, are far from adequate to understand the changes that have taken place in media and in social systems over this period. Take for example David Harvey’s generally very useful little book A Brief History of Neoliberalism. This book says curiously little about the media, though it could be argued that changes in the media system are actually rather central to the rise of neoliberalism. This is because market-based media have often displaced non-market forms of social organisation – as political marketing, for example, displaces older forms of political organisation – and because contemporary media are among the ‘new apparatuses that integrate subjects into a moral nexus of identiﬁcations’ (Rose 1996: 57-8) that are crucial to the ‘government at a distance’ that constitutes what Rose calls ‘advanced liberalism’. What Harvey does say is the following (p. 80): ‘a few media magnates control most of the ﬂow of news, much of which then becomes pure propaganda’. This analysis is consistent with Harvey’s general interpretation of neoliberalism as above all a restoration of the social and political power of economic elites. Many accounts within media studies characterise the shift to neoliberalism in the media sphere rather differently, as a process of depoliticisation, in which media lose their function as institutions of the public sphere and are absorbed into the world of commerce and consumption as mere vehicles for advertising and for a commodiﬁed entertainment industry. There are ways in which these two formulations might be reconciled, but they are different enough on the surface to suggest the need for a fairly careful analysis about just what the signiﬁcance of the shift toward more market-driven media actually is.",non-technical,-,
"The primary task of a linguist is to “remove the filter” as far as possible, that is, to assess the nature of the recording process in all possible and relevant ways and to evaluate and take into account its likely impact on the relationship between the speech event and the record, to reconstruct the speech event itself, as accurately as possible. This chapter discusses some possibilities and problems associated with this approach, and some necessary considerations and steps in the process of “filter removal.” It considers basic requirements for texts to be acceptable for variationist analyses, categorizes them by text types, and talks about some characteristics of the most important text types in the light of their usefulness for variationist purposes. The chapter proposes five text categories which represent a continuum of increasing distance between an original speech event and its written record.

"Background: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in both civilian and military populations. Routine neuroimaging has limitations in detecting subtle brain parenchymal changes, predicting prognosis, and assessing cerebral perfusion, metabolite levels, and mechanical properties after TBI. Advanced neuroimaging techniques have emerged as promising tools for the diagnosis, prognostication, and treatment of TBI. Aim of Study: This review aims to summarize the role of advanced neuroimaging techniques in the evaluation and man-agement of TBI. The focus is on ultrasound (US)-based tech-niques, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based techniques, and molecular imaging-based techniques, including positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission com-puted tomography (SPECT). Methods: The review involves a comprehensive analysis of existing research on advanced neuroimaging techniques for TBI. The included techniques are contrast-enhanced US, intravascular US, US elastography, diffusion tensor imaging, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, perfusion-weighted imag-ing, magnetic resonance elastography, functional MRI, PET, and SPECT. Results: Advanced neuroimaging techniques, such as US-based, MRI-based, and molecular imaging-based techniques, have shown potential in the evaluation and management of TBI. These techniques provide improved visualization of subtle brain parenchymal changes, allow for the assessment of cere-bral perfusion, metabolites, and mechanical properties, and of-fer prognostic information. However, further clinical validation and larger studies are needed to establish their routine clinical use. Conclusion: Advanced neuroimaging techniques offer val-uable insights into TBI by overcoming the limitations of rou-tine neuroimaging. US-based, MRI-based, and molecular im-aging-based techniques provide additional information for the diagnosis, prognostication, and treatment of TBI. Continued research and validation are necessary to enhance the clinical utility of these techniques.

"Automatic bas-relief generation from 2D photographs potentially has applications to coinage, commemorative medals and souvenirs. However, current methods are not yet ready for real use in industry due to insufficient artistic effect, noticeable distortion, and unbalanced contrast. We previously proposed a shape-from-shading (SFS) based method to automatically generate bas-reliefs from single frontal photographs of human faces; however, suppression of unwanted details remained a problem. Here, we give experimental results showing how incorporating non-photorealistic rendering (NPR) into our previous framework enables us to both suppress unwanted detail, and yet also emphasize important features. We have consider an alternative approach to recovering relief shape, based on photometric stereo instead of SFS for surface orientation estimation.

"We read with great interest the article by Jian Zhu et al.1 “The Gantry Crane Technique: A Novel Technique for Treating Severe Thoracic Spinal Stenosis and Myelopathy Caused by Ossification of the Ligamentum Flavum and Preliminary Clinical Results” recently published in the March 2023 issue of Global Spine Journal. The study presents an innovative operative method for treating severe thoracic spinal stenosis and myelopathy caused by ossification of the ligamentum flavum (OLF), and it can improve clinical outcomes and reduce the postoperative complications. We appreciate the authors’ efforts and innovations in spine surgery; however, we have a confusion that need to be clarified after reading this article.
In the article, the authors claimed their experience about the posterior elevation height of laminae and ossified ligament complex (LOC) was that elevation of 102 mm could ensure adequate decompression and avoid dural tears caused by excessive lifting in the eighth page of the fifth row. However, Sun J et al.2 reported the analogous bridge crane technique, in which they explained that a sufficient elevation height was 10.3 mm to treat severe thoracic spinal stenosis and myelopathy. Yan C et al.3 reported using computer-based 3D simulations to formulate preoperative planning of bridge crane technique for thoracic ossification of the ligamentum flavum (TOLF). The posterior elevation height of LOC was about 7 mm. Furthermore, the above three articles are from the same unit and have co-authors. Their huge differences make us doubt the accuracy of the data.
The height of posterior suspension of LOC is the core of the gantry grane Technique, and it’s decisive to the operation. If too high, it will lead to dural tears, and if too low, there will be insufficient decompression. In addition, as experienced spine surgeons, we have performed similar operations. And we know the elevation of the LOC is 10 mm approximately, which would not be 102 mm. So, might it be 10.2 mm in the artical?
Despite this confusion, the authors made a great contribution to this field. We once again gratitude the authors for their contributions.",non-technical,-,

"Background: Radiomics involves the retrieval of numerical information from medical imaging, with the ability to describe the characteristics of a tumor. The radiomics technique has the ability to create prognostic models for therapy response, which is crucial for the advancement of personalized medicine.
Aim of Study: This literature review provides a concise overview and assesses the scientific rigor and reporting stand-ards of radiomics research in predicting treatment response in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
Methods: An extensive literature search was performed us-ing the PubMed database. The radiomics quality score (RQS), a measure specifically designed for radiomics, was used to evalu-ate the scientific and reporting quality, following the parameters set by TRIPOD.
Results: The studies included in the analysis revealed sev-eral predictive markers, including first-, second-, and high-or-der features. These characteristics included kurtosis, grey-level uniformity, and wavelet HLL mean, as well as PET-based met-abolic indicators. The studies exhibited significant variability as a result of variations in patient demographics, cancer stage, treatment methods, duration of follow-up, and radiomics pro- cessing protocols.
Conclusion: The use of radiomics research in clinical prac- tice has not yet been implemented. To develop radiomic pre-dictors of response that can be reproduced, it is necessary to make efforts toward standardization and cooperation. In order for radiomic models to be used as a clinical decision-making tool for personalized treatment of patients with NSCLC, it is necessary to verify them externally and assess their effect with-in the therapeutic pathway	",non-technical,-,

"The effects of changing to an online delivery mechanism within a third year, undergraduate, module have been evaluated against the lecturing staff's intended move towards a student-centred, constructivist learning approach. It has been suggested that this type of delivery can increase critical thinking and active learning for students. In the study described in this paper, qualitative analytical techniques were used in order to explore students'experiences of online delivery. The study addressed their perceptions about online methods as well as the educational implications of their patterns of usage of online resources. The findings suggest that students were quick to overcome anxieties about online learning but generally did not develop any significant degree of discussion. It is argued that a move to online delivery needs a greater attention to design and development of facilitator skills than has been previously recognized.

"Background: Liver metastases are a common occurrence in metastatic illness and play a crucial role in determining treatment and  prognosis. Various imaging methods, including
ultrasonography, computed tomography (CT), magnetic reso-nance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET)/CT, and PET/MRI, can be used for non-invasive evaluation of
liver metastases.Aim of Study: This study aims to provide a comprehen-sive analysis of imaging results of liver metastases, focusing on the unique benefits and possible drawbacks of each imaging method. The significance of different imaging techniques for treatment, monitoring, and evaluation of liver metastases is also evaluated. Methods: The study involves a review and analysis of existing literature on imaging techniques for liver metastases. Imaging methods such as ultrasonography, CT, MRI, PET/CT, and PET/MRI are examined, and their strengths and limitations are discussed. Results: Both CT and MRI are considered suitable im-aging techniques for detecting early liver lesions, monitoring progression, and assessing treatment effectiveness. Multipara-metric MRI, in particular, has shown significant advancements in recent years, offering improved hardware, software, and spe-cialized contrast agents. MRI has demonstrated superior perfor-mance in detecting small-sized metastases and cases of hepatic steatosis. However, despite the higher sensitivity of MRI, CT remains the preferred approach for imaging liver metastases. Conclusion: CT and MRI are the primary imaging methods for liver metastases, with each having its advantages and limi-tations. While MRI has shown promising results, CT continues to be the preferred choice due to factors such as cost-effective-ness. Further research and discussions are necessary to address the economic implications of using CT instead of MRI for liver metastasis imaging	",non-technical,-,

"Background: Electronic health records (HER) use has in-creased in recent years, but there is a lack of detailedresearch on identifying asymptomatic diseases (ADEs) in ambulatory set-tings. This study aims to address this gap by examining meth-ods of ADE identification in the ambulatory setting, as patients often have less contact with their physicians and maintain less thorough records. This will ensure accurate measurement of
ADEs and reproducibility in future research. Aim of Study: The objectives of our study was to analyze the techniques used and establish the functions of electronic health records (EHRs) in the identification and evaluation of adverse drug events (ADEs) in the ambulatory environment.
Methods: Our research included doing a systematic lit-erature review by searching PubMed and Google Scholar for papers published before June 2017. These studies focused on adverse drug events (ADEs) that were discovered in the ambu-latory environment and used the use of electronic health records (EHRs). We collected information on the features of the studies included in our analysis about the procedures used to identify
adverse drug events (ADEs). Results: Researchers used the Electronic Health Record (EHR) as a data source and utilized it to produce patient safe-
ty reports, which were then employed in the identification of Adverse Drug Events (ADEs). The identification methods used included manual record review conducted by skilled nurses, pharmacists, and/or doctors, prescription review, computer monitors, electronic triggers, International Classification of Diseases codes, natural language analysis of clinical notes, and patient phone calls and surveys.

instances of search keywords, laboratory results, and criteria used to detect adverse drug events (ADEs). Conclusion: Overall, most of the studies analyzed used Electronic Health Records (EHRs) as the primary data source for detecting Adverse Drug Events (ADEs). This retrospective
methodology is suitable for quantifying the occurrence rates of Adverse Drug Events (ADEs), but it is insufficient for iden-tifying preventive ADEs before damage is inflicted upon the patient. Researchers will be able to detect and address avoida-ble adverse drug events (ADEs) using advanced techniques that use computer monitors and electrical triggers.

"This paper deals mainly the use of high speed photography technique, aided with identification, on the field of mechanism design. As an example, an experimental combined with mechanism synthsis has been taken on model JGN 202 wool loom for analysing the real movements of this mechanism. The lobby mechanism is of complicate cams and multi-linkages. Based on theoretical analysis and calculation, the displacement, velocity and acceleration curves were obtained for this mechanism by using of high speed photography technique. In comparison of the experimental results with the theoretical calculated curves, they appeared so closely. Not only the reliability of theoretical analysis can be checked properly, but also by the valuable data of errors presented between two sets of curves, experimental and theoretical respectively, further studying can be carried out about the affection of elastic deformation and clearence of this mechanism. Furthermore, the obtained data are reliable and accurate as the measurements were taken in non-contact condition, so it is an effective way to use this method for design and research of mechanisms evidently. Therefore, the introduce of high speed photography technique is of general significance in the area of researching work on mechanisms, and looking forward further progress appear far and wide",non-technical,-,

"Parasitic infections especially intestinal parasites are considered as a common disease in developing countries and in resource limited regions of the world. Globally about 3.5 billion people are affected and 450 million complain as a result of those infects. Most commonly pre-schoolers, school aged children are affected with these infections. So it is extremely important to make aware about the nail clipping and hand washing for the prevention of intestinal parasites among school going children aged 6-12 years. The study aimed to assess the knowledge and provide planned teaching programme regarding hand washing and nail clipping for prevention of intestinal parasites among school going children. Evaluative approach, pre-experimental one group-pre-test and post-test design was used. Data was collected from 40 school going children selected by using non-probability purposive convenient sampling technique. During pre-test, self-administered knowledge questionnaire was given to children and knowledge was assessed. A planned teaching programme was then carried out by the researcher and a self-administered knowledge questionnaire again was administered to assess the post-test knowledge. The present study results showed that an overall increase in the knowledge score was observed after planned teaching programme, with mean knowledge score of 17.6. The Paired ‘t’ test showed that there was a significant overall increase in knowledge scores which was tested at 5% level (p <0.05).

"Background: The emergence of COVID-19 in late 2019 led to a global public health emergency. The virus responsible for the infection, SARS-CoV-2, belongs to the beta-coronavi-rus family. The reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test is currently the most reliable method for detect-ing the virus in respiratory samples. Imaging findings of COV-ID-19, particularly in the lungs, have been extensively studied, with chest computed tomography (CT) and X-ray being com-monly used modalities. Other imaging techniques, such as lung ultrasonography and positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT), have also shown promise in assessing COVID-19 patients. Aim of Study: This study aims to explore the functions of current imaging modalities and identify the prevailing radiolog-ical symptoms of COVID-19. Methods: The study involves a review and analysis of ex-isting research on imaging modalities used in COVID-19. The search terms used include COVID-19, radiology, chest X-ray, lung ultrasonography, computed tomography, and positron emission tomography-computed tomography. Results: COVID-19 pneumonia is typically characterized by bilateral and peripheral distribution of ground-glass opac-ities and consolidations in imaging findings. Chest CT and X-ray have been widely used to assess COVID-19 patients and identify relevant radiological features. Lung ultrasonography, a developing method, has demonstrated a strong ability to detect even small changes in the lungs, making it valuable for initial assessment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. PET-CT integration al-lows for precise localization of affected areas and monitoring of treatment outcomes. Conclusion: Current imaging modalities, including chest CT, X-ray, lung ultrasonography, and PET-CT, play important roles in the assessment and management of COVID-19 pa-tients. These modalities provide valuable information about the radiological manifestations of the disease, aiding in diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment evaluation.",non-technical,-,

"Purpose
To evaluate the safety, efficacy and merits of laparoscopic repair in children with hydroceles by comparing the outcomes of laparoscopic repair and the traditional open repair (OR) procedure. The outcomes of the following three laparoscopic percutaneous extra-peritoneal closure (LPEC) approaches were also compared: conventional two-port surgery, transumbilical single-site two-port surgery and single-port surgery.
Methods
We retrospectively compared the demographic, perioperative and follow-up data from the consecutive records obtained for 382 boys who underwent OR and 950 boys who underwent LPEC at two children’s medical centres in China. In the LPEC group, regardless of the hydrocele form, one of the three approaches with percutaneous aspiration was performed: conventional two-port surgery was performed in 387 cases, single-site two-port surgery was performed in 468 cases and single-port surgery was performed in 95 cases. The clinical data and complications were statistically analysed.
Results
Postoperative follow-up data were obtained for all the patients. The mean follow-up time was 36 months (24–48 months) in the OR group and 32.5 months (20–44 months) in the LPEC group. Significant differences in recurrence were not observed between the groups (five in the OR and 10 in the LPEC; P = 0.69). However, the operation time, postoperative hospital stay, incidence of scrotal oedema, incision infection and contralateral metachronous hernia or hydrocele were significantly higher in the OR group than those in the LPEC group (P < 0.01). Eighteen children (4.71%) had a negative exploration of the patent processus vaginalis (PPV) in the OR group. Fourteen children (1.47%) in the LPEC group had a closed internal ring and were converted to a scrotal procedure. Significant differences in the clinical data or complications were not observed between the two centres for the laparoscopic procedure (P > 0.05). Contralateral PPV (cPPV) was found in 18 patients in the single-port group (18.9%). Of the patients affected with cPPV, significant differences were observed between the single-port group and the two-port LPEC group (122 patients, 31.5%, P = 0.016) and the single-site two-port group (the 148 patients, 31.6%, P = 0.013). A contralateral metachronous hernia or hydrocele was found in zero, zero and two cases in these groups, respectively, and significant differences were observed (P < 0.01) between the single-site surgery and the other two laparoscopic approaches.
Conclusions
LPEC is safe, feasible and effective for treating hydroceles in children and has the same recurrence rate as OR. However, LPEC is superior in operation time, hospital stay, occurrence of scrotal oedema, incision infection and occurrence of metachronous hernia or hydrocele. The transumbilical single-site two-port procedure has the same cosmetic effect as the single-port LPEC. According to our experience, the two-port LPEC approach is better for diagnosing cPPV and reducing metachronous hernia or hydrocele than the single-port LPEC procedure.",non-technical,-,

"Soil pollution by heavy metals/metalloids (HMMs) is a problem worldwide. To prevent dispersion of contaminated particles by erosion, the maintenance of a vegetative cover is needed. Successful plant establishment in multi-polluted soils can be hampered not only by HMM toxicities, but also by soil nutrient deficiencies and the co-occurrence of abiotic stresses. Some plant species are able to thrive under these multi-stress scenarios often linked to marked fluctuations in environmental factors. This study aimed to investigate the metabolic adjustments involved in Zygophyllum fabago acclimative responses to conditions prevailing in HMM-enriched mine-tailings piles, during Mediterranean spring and summer. To this end, fully expanded leaves, and rhizosphere soil, of three contrasting mining and non-mining populations of Z. fabago grown spontaneously in south-eastern Spain were sampled in two consecutive years. Approximately 50 biochemical, physiological and edaphic parameters were examined, including leaf redox components, primary and secondary metabolites, endogenous levels of salicylic acid, and physicochemical properties of soil (fertility parameters and total concentration of HMMs). Multivariate data analysis showed a clear distinction in antioxidative/oxidative profiles between and within the populations studied. Levels of chlorophylls, proteins and proline characterized control plants whereas antioxidant capacity and C- and S-based antioxidant compounds were biomarkers of mining plants. Seasonal variations were characterized by higher levels of alkaloids and PAL and soluble peroxidase activities in summer, and by soluble sugars and hydroxycinnamic acids in spring irrespective of the population considered. Although the antioxidant systems are subjected to seasonal variations, the way and the intensity with which every population changes its antioxidative/oxidative profile seem to be determined by soil conditions. In short, Z. fabago displays a high physiological plasticity that allow it to successfully shift its metabolism to withstand the multiple stresses that plants must cope with in mine tailings piles under Mediterranean climatic conditions.",non-technical,-,

"Uterine fibroids are the most common gynaecological disorder, classically requiring surgery when symptomatic. Although attempts at finding a nonsurgical cure date back to centuries, it is only around the middle of the last century that serious attempts at a medical treatment were carried out. Initially, both progestins and estrogen–progestin combinations have been utilized, although proof of their usefulness is lacking. A major step forward was achieved when peptide analogues of the GnRH were introduced, first those with super agonist properties and subsequently those acting as antagonists. Because both types of analogues produce hypoestrogenism, their use is limited to a maximum of 6 months and, so they can’t be used routinely but utilized as an adjuvant treatment before surgery with overall good results. Over the last decade, new, nonpeptidic, orally active GnRH-receptor blockers Elagolix and another development of selective progesterone receptor modulators, sometimes referred to as “antiprogestins of choice is Ulipristal acetate are promising.Large clinical trials have proven the effectiveness of Ulipristal in the long-term medical therapy of fibroids, caution must taken for liver complications. All selective progesterone receptor modulators produce unique endometrial changes that are today considered benign, reversible, and without negative consequences. Long-term medical treatment of fibroids seems possible today, especially in premenopausal women. Surgical treatments are myomectomy, radiofrequency ablation procedure, endometrial ablation, uterine artery embolization, magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound myolysis are effective and reserved for the women who desires to keep uterus, and morcellation .

"The present research is aimed to calculating the porosity of anodes in solid oxide fuel cell through Mercury Intrusion porosimetry (MIP). There are various techniques used to measure the porosity of the solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC). MIP is a method used to find the porosity of anodes due to its high accuracy, and some additional information which includes particle size distribution, pore size distribution, average pore size and bulk density. The working principal of MIP is that when sample is filled with mercury then high pressure is applied which makes the mercury to penetrate into the pores of the sample. The instrument measures the pore volume with the help of capacitive system as the pressure gradually increases to its maximum value and then decrease to its lowest value. This system calculates the volume of mercury intruded for each pressure whether the pressure is increasing or decreasing. The instrument is connected to a computer with dedicated software which calculates the percentage porosity of the sample. The results suggested the importance of PH and agitator on porosity. What we have to provide is the sample mass, sample density and the temperature of the laboratory. However for cleaning purposes of mercury, ethanol could be used instead of acetone, as mercury intrusion porosimeter involves few plastic parts like dilatometer holder and cap.

"Background: Benchmarking is widely acknowledged as a good approach for identifying strengths and shortcomings across all levels of the healthcare system. Although there is an increasing interest in the practice and research of benchmark-ing, its impact on the quality of treatment has not been well explained. Consequently, we performed a methodical analysis of existing literature to combine the data on the correlation be-tween benchmarking and enhancing quality. Aim of Study: This study aims to gather information on the measures that might be used to enhance quality improvement. Methods: We conducted a comprehensive search across three databases (PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus) toidentify papers that examined the influence of benchmarking on the quality of care, including both the procedures and re-sults. After evaluating the articles for inclusion, we performed data analysis, quality assessment, and critical synthesis in ac-cordance with the PRISMA criteria for conducting a systematic literature review. Results: There were a total of 17 items that were found. All studies found a favorable correlation between the use of bench-marking and the enhancement of quality in terms of processes (N = 10), outcomes (N = 13), or both (N = 7). Out of the 12 stud-ies analyzed, most of them included an additional intervention, in addition to benchmarking, to encourage the enhancement of quality. The treatments varied from participant meetings to quality improvement plans and cash incentives. More than half of the trials (N = 10) used a mix of various therapies. Conclusion: The findings derived from this analysis in-dicate that benchmarking in healthcare is an expanding area, and more investigation is necessary to have a deeper compre-hension of its impact on enhancing quality. Moreover, our re-search suggests that benchmarking may promote enhancements in quality, and that additional treatments, in conjunction with benchmarking, seem to strengthen this improvement. While this study suggests that integrating performance assessment with treatments might improve quality, future research should focus on analyzing the individual effect of these interventions",non-technical,-,

Our main results are as follows: (i) we identify a total of 328 primary studies relevant to our scope published between 1989 and 2020, of which 44% published during the last 5 years and 24% involved industry; (ii) the majority of studies are evaluated through Examples (41%) and Experience Reports (38%), while full-fledged Case Studies are limited (1.5%); (iii) Model checking is the most commonly adopted technique (47%), followed by simulation (27%) and theorem proving (19.5%); (iv) the dominant languages are UML (18%) and B (15%), while frequently used tools are ProB (9%), NuSMV (8%), and UPPAAL (7%); however, a diverse landscape of languages and tools is employed; (v) the majority of systems are interlocking products (40%), followed by models of high-level control logic (27%); and (vi) most of the studies focus on the Architecture (66%) and Detailed Design (45%) development phases. Based on these findings, we highlight current research gaps and expected actions. In particular, the need to focus on more empirically sound research methods, such as Case Studies and Controlled Experiments, and to lower the degree of abstraction, by applying formal methods and tools to development phases that are closer to software development. Our study contributes with an empirically based perspective on the future of research and practice in formal methods applications for railways. It can be used by formal methods researchers to better focus their scientific inquiries, and by railway practitioners for an improved understanding of the interplay between formal methods and their specific application domain.

"These are some of the causes of the severe impact on handicraft workers during COVID-19, such as adverse effects on finance, disruptions in the supply chain, decreased demand, reduction in sales, order cancellations, and less profit. Among others over 90% of handicraft workers were neither prepared nor had any plan to handle such a situation. Further, more than two-thirds of participating enterprises reported not surviving. I have used interpretation methods in my research in which the review paper is taken from a lot of literature. I have also taken the help of schemes, research, and government reports done by the government. The data were analyzed through descriptive methods. The finding of this research paper is based on previous studies/ research based on this topic. Government socioeconomic policy recommendation is helpful to overcome that phase, which directly affected the condition of handicraft artisans. To overcome that situation different efforts are taken by the government of India but this is not only the responsibility of the government but also NGOs, Trust, Corporate social responsibilities, and social workers have to contribute to the welfare of the handicraft artisans.

"Steganography is the art and science of secret communication, aiming to conceal the existence of a communication, which has been used in military, and perhaps terrorists. Steganography in the modern day sense of the word usually refers to information or a file that has been concealed inside a digital Picture, Video or Audio file. In steganography, the actual information is not maintained in its original format and thereby it is converted into an alternative equivalent multimedia file like image, video or audio, which in turn is being hidden within another object. Information Security is becoming an inseparable part of Data Communication. In order to address this Information Security, Steganography plays an important role. The digital media steganalysis is divided into three domains, which are image steganalysis, audio steganalysis, and video steganalysis. DNA sequences possess some interesting properties, which can be utilized to hide data. This paper is a review of the recent steganography techniques and utilization of DNA sequence appeared in the literature.

"In the field of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning is a subset that focuses on using data to learn and create prediction algorithms. Electronics controls the flow of electricity for processing, and health entails more than just being free from disease. On the other hand, overusing devices can increase health hazards. The inquiry consists of an empirical study that was carried out in Istanbul, Turkey, with 1147 students, as well as a systematic evaluation of ML applications in mental health within the human-computer interface (HCI) literature. The condition of emotional, psychological, and social well-being that affects a person's thoughts, feelings, and behaviour in day-to-day living is known as mental health. The study examines how teens' mental and physical health are affected by their excessive use of digital gadgets, especially cellphones. In this artical the integration of digital technologies and machine learning (ML) in relation to teenage wellbeing and mental health treatment is examined. The assessment also emphasises the necessity of humancentered and morally sound machine learning applications in mental health services. It also discusses how machine learning (ML) might improve mental health services by improving the identification, diagnosis, and treatment of mental health issues. The results show that teens' psychiatric problems, musculoskeletal discomfort, and sleep disruptions are linked to excessive digital device useThe study comes to the conclusion that while ML and digital technologies have a great deal of promise for enhancing mental health outcomes, there are also important socio-technical issues that require attention. These include worries about model bias, data privacy, and the generalisation of machine learning algorithms. Future studies should concentrate on creating rigorous assessment frameworks and transdisciplinary methods to guarantee the ethical and successful application of ML in mental health services.",non-technical,-,

"Reasoners compare problems to prior cases to draw conclusions about a problem and guide decision making. All Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) employs some methods for generalizing from cases to support indexing and relevance assessment and evidences two basic inference methods: constraining search by tracing a solution from a past case or evaluating a case by comparing it to past cases. Across domains and tasks, however, humans reason with cases in subtly different ways evidencing different mixes of and mechanisms for these components.
In recent CBR research in Artificial Intelligence (AI), five paradigmatic approaches have emerged: statistically-oriented, model-based, planning/design-oriented, exemplar-based, and adversarial or precedent-based. The paradigms differ in the assumptions they make about domain models, the extent to which they support symbolic case comparison, and the kinds of inferences for which they employ cases.
Reasoning with cases is important in legal practice of all kinds, and legal practice involves a wide variety of case-based tasks and methods. The paradigms' respective benefits and costs suggest different approaches for different legal tasks.
CBR research and development in the field of AI and Law should be pursued vigoriously for several reasons. CBR can supplement rule-based expert systems, improving their abilities to reason about statutory predicates, solve problems efficiently, and explain their results. CBR can also contribute to the design of intelligent legal data retrieval systems and improve legal document assembly programs.

"Grammar is considered one of the most challenging aspect in acquiring and learning a language. The teacher’s aim in teaching grammar is to teach the structures of a language systematically and help the students obtain grammatical structures accurately. In Vietnam, English grammar is usually focused on because Vietnamese students think that they can use English when they know grammar rules well. It is really important when students are ready to use English to express themselves through context in their real life in either speaking or writing. The ability to work in a group is known as one of the most important skills of all students. The effectiveness of group work can be found among students. It is very important when the teacher gives task to the groups, and chooses the groups’ leaders. It is understandable that the leaders is responsible for the task of the groups so he/ she must divide the work into individuals; in that situation, in group students have to work independently, they are able to control the pace of their work to keep up with other members in the group to complete their task and ensure their group’s work is able to be done correctly and on time. The primary aim of this study was to explore the effectiveness of using group work in teaching grammar to the first year non-English major students in Accounting class 1 at Thai Nguyen Univeristy of Econimics and Business Administration (TUEBA). The teachers’ and students’ opinions were collected through questionaires and the results of this study demonstarted that using the group work in teaching grammar can bring the effectiveness to the students’ results.

"We demonstrate that I-V curves with bypass diodes in forward bias can be useful in learning the heterogeneity in PV modules. In the laboratory-based experiments, we show that heterogeneity in a PV module can be detected from “step” IV curves that are collected under non-uniform irradiance. On the other hand, heterogeneous cell performance can lead to bypassing even under uniform irradiance. This hypothesis was tested using a fabricated 4-cell mini-module with cells that were engineered to have highly heterogeneous front contact resistivity and a SPICE-based circuit model. We find good agreement between the experimentally determined curve and simulations. We illustrate a technique for automatically classifying and analyzing massive real-world I-V curves and for gaining insights into the performance of PV modules. By classifying 3.7 million I-V curves, we demonstrate the occurrence of “step” I-V curves under two irradiance conditions: under non-uniform irradiance condition, mirror augmented PV module in Cleveland, Ohio; and under uniform irraidance condition at the Negev Desert, Israel, Gran Canaria, Spain and Mount Zugspitze, Germany. Under the uniform irradiance conditions, we found that the percentage of “step” I-V curves in all three I-V curve types gradually increase over time. This indicates the electrical characteristics within a PV module change from homogeneous to heterogeneous. Since the “step” I-V curves have a lower maximum power and a lower fill factor than normal I-V curves at the same irradiance condition, the heterogeneity in I-V module directly cause power degradation",non-technical,-,

"Non-contiguous orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) is a promising technique for cognitive radio systems. The secondary users transmit on the selected subcarriers to avoid the frequencies being used by the primary users. However, the out-of-band power (OBP) of the OFDM-modulated tones induces interference to the primary users. Another major drawback of OFDM-based system is their high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). In this paper, algorithms are proposed to jointly reduce the OBP and the PAPR for non-contiguous OFDM based on the method of alternating projections onto convex sets. Several OFDM subcarriers are selected to accommodate the adjusting weights for OBP and PAPR reduction. The frequency-domain OFDM symbol is projected onto two convex sets that are defined according to the OBP requirements and the PAPR limits. Each projection iteration solves a convex optimization problem. The projection onto the set constrained by the OBP requirement can be calculated using an iterative algorithm which has low computational complexity. Simulation results show good performance of joint reduction of the OBP and the PAPR. The proposed algorithms converge quickly in a few iterations",non-technical,-,

"Vascular endothelial dysfunction is a common and early event occurring in many disease conditions, such as ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, vascular complications of diabetes, and clinical procedures that injure blood vessels. The hallmark of endothelial dysfunction is reduced bioavailability of nitric oxide (NO) and consequent increased free radical production. These radicals trigger the inflammatory response, a major contributor to tissue injury. Measuring free radical release in biological models facilitates assessment of the biochemical mechanisms responsible for regulating the production of these biomolecules. This technical review focuses on the application of real-time measurement of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and NO release in models of I/R and blood vessel injury.

The predictors that may be influenced by interventions and are worth mentioning are: (1) the overall time spent on electronic health record (EHR) use, (2) The time spent on EHR outside regular working hours, (3) The availability of on-site assistance for EHR usage, (4) The perceived ease of use of the EHR system, (5) The amount of workload related to managing in-basket messages, and (6) the burden of documentation. Physician suggestions also reiterated these recurring ideas.
Conclusion: EHR-related well-being among doctors is in-fluenced by several intricate elements. Our analysis reveals that doctors provide suggestions that cover a wide range of topics, including government rules, organizational policies, and adjust-ments to electronic health records (EHR). Subsequent studies should evaluate comprehensive therapies that target these char-acteristics. Physicians, being the main stakeholders, should be included in the design and execution of these changes to ensure that they are compatible with their demands and clinical work-flows

"This paper showcases the use of PDE-based graph methods for modern machine learning applications. We consider a case study of body-worn video classification because of the large volume of data and the lack of training data due to sensitivity of the information. Many modern artificial intelligence methods are turning to deep learning which typically requires a lot of training data to be effective. They can also suffer from issues of trust because the heavy use of training data can inadvertently provide information about details of the training images and could compromise privacy. Our alternate approach is a physics-based machine learning that uses classical ideas like optical flow for video analysis paired with linear mixture models such as non-negative matrix factorization along with PDE-based graph classification methods that parallel geometric equations from PDE such as motion by mean curvature. The up- shot is a methodology that can work well on video with modest amounts of training data and that can also be used to compress the information about the video scene so that no personal information is contained in the compressed data, making it possible to provide a larger group of people access to these compressed data without compromising privacy. The compressed data retains information about the wearer of the camera while discarding information about people, objects, and places in the scene.",non-technical,-,

"In this paper, we examine the solitary wave solutions of the generalised (2 + 1) extended Kadomtsev–Petviashvili (eKP) equation, which is used as model for the surface waves and internal waves in straits or channels and describes the dynamics of nonlinear waves in plasma physics and fluid dynamics. We secure distinct soliton solutions by employing two amelioration methodologies, namely the improved F-expansion method and the new Kudryashov method. These methods explore several unique forms of solitary wave solutions, including dark, rational, singular, periodic, and exponential ones. In order to illustrate propagation of some reported wave solutions, the graphs associated with these solutions are presented by choosing appropriate parametric values in 2D, 3D, contour, and density plots with the use of the symbolic software Mathematica 13.0. The presented solutions realize very significant fact for investigation the qualitative interpretations for various phenomena in our nature.

"In recent years, numerous studies have demonstrated the significant potential of non-Saccharomyces yeasts in aroma generation during fermentation. In this study, 134 strains of yeast were isolated from traditional fermented foods. Subsequently, through primary and tertiary screening, 28 strains of aroma-producing non-Saccharomyces yeast were selected for beer brewing. Headspace-solid phase microextraction (HS-SPME) combined with gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) and chemometrics were employed to analyze the volatile flavor substances in beer samples fermented using these strains. Chemometric analysis revealed that distinct species of non-Saccharomyces yeast had a unique influence on beer aroma, with strains from the same genus producing more similar flavor profiles. Accordingly, 2,6-nonadienal, 1-pentanol, phenyl ethanol, isoamyl acetate, ethyl caprate, butyl butyrate, ethyl propionate, furfuryl alcohol, phenethyl acetate, ethyl butyrate, ethyl laurate, acetic acid, and 3-methyl-4 heptanone were identified as the key aroma compounds for distinguishing among different non-Saccharomyces yeast species. This work provides useful insights into the aroma-producing characteristics of different non-Saccharomyces yeasts to reference the targeted improvement of beer aroma.

"Chinese medical concept normalization, which maps non-standard medical concepts to standard expressions, is a NLP task with wide-ranging applications in medical big data research and clinical statistic. Many previous works apply supervised methods which require a lot of annotated data. However, they can not address the challenge brought by the high cost of medical data annotation, which requires sufficient professional knowledge and experience. Meanwhile, existing unsupervised methods perform poorly facing the various non-standard expression from different data sources. In this paper, we propose DUNE, Disease Unsupervised Normalization by Embedding, an unsupervised Chinese medical concept normalization framework by applying denoising auto-encoder (DAE) and network embedding. We formulate this task as finding mention-entity pairs with great text and comorbidity similarity. To handle the noise in text, we design a multi-view attention based denoising auto-encoder (MADAE) to capture text information from multiple views, reduce the influence of noise, and transform text to denoised vectors. To introduce comorbidity information, we construct a comorbidity network with both standard and non-standard disease names as nodes from medical records. Because of the diversity of nonstandard expressions, one disease perhaps corresponds to several different nodes, which causes noise in comorbidity network. To handle such network structure noise, we propose a denoising network embedding framework, which reduce the structure noise with the help of text information, to embed the nodes to vectors for comorbidity similarity measurement. Convincing experiment results show that our method performs better than existing unsupervised baselines and approaches the performance of classical supervised machine learning model on this task.",non-technical,-,

"Purpose
Incisional ventral hernias (IHs) are a common complication across all surgical specialities requiring access to the abdomen, pelvis, and retroperitoneum. This public health issue continues to be widely ignored, resulting in appreciable morbidity and expenses. In this critical review, the issue is explored by an interdisciplinary group.
Methods
A group of European surgeons encompassing representatives from abdominal wall, vascular, urological, gynecological, colorectal and hepato-pancreatico-biliary surgery have reviewed the occurrence of His in these disciplines.
Results
Incisional hernias are a major public health issue with appreciable morbidity and cost implications. General surgeons are commonly called upon to repair IHs following an initial operation by others. Measures that may collectively reduce the frequency of IH across specialities include better planning and preparation (e.g. a fit patient, no time pressure, an experienced operator). A minimally invasive technique should be employed where appropriate. Our main recommendations in midline incisions include using the ‘small bites’ suture technique with a ≥ 4:1 suture-to-wound length, and adding prophylactic mesh augmentation in patients more likely to suffer herniation. For off-midline incisions, more research of this problem is essential.
Conclusion
Meticulous closure of the incision is significant for every patient. Raising awareness of the His is necessary in all surgical disciplines that work withing the abdomen or retroperitoneum. Across all specialties, surgeons should aim for a < 10% IH rate.

"Laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation are important airway securing techniques for patients undergoing general anaesthesia in operating room. This procedure is associated with significant hemodynamic changes putting undue stress in the heart and the brain circulation . Multiple drug therapies have been used to attenuate these responses, but none have been entirely successful till date. Hence aim of the study is to evaluate effects of single, low dose dexmedetomidine premedication on hemodynamic stress response during laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation in patient posted for elective surgeries under general anaesthesia requiring endotracheal intubation.
Methodology: A prospective, observational study conducted in Bir Hospital and National Trauma Center after approval from Institutional Review Board with enrollment of 52 patients of American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status I and II divided into two equal groups. Dexmedetomidine group received 0.5 microgram per kilogram premedication infusion over 10 minutes. Haemodynamic parameters (heart rate and blood pressures) at baseline, after induction, just before intubation, 1, 3, 5 and 10 minutes after intubation were recorded. The general anaesthesia technique was standarized for both groups. p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results: Demographic data were comparable. Statistically significant decrease (p < 0.05) in heart rate, systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressures in dexmedetomidine group. None of the patients in dexmedetomidine group had hypotension, bradycardia hypertension and tachycardia.
Conclusion: Dexmedetomidine premedication with 0.5 μg/kg is better for attenuating stress response due to laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation.

"BACKGROUND:
Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) is a mature scanning technique. With high sensitivity in detecting cerebral infractions, it has become an essential part of the clinical evaluation of acute stroke. However, with the update in medical ideals and treatment, clinicians are now focusing on distinguishing between reversible and irreversible brain tissue damage rather than detecting ischaemic lesions alone.
OBJECTIVE:
We supposed that Diffusion Kurtosis Imaging (DKI) could classify heterogeneous DWI lesions, deepening the understanding of tissue injury. We systematically studied the different parameters of DKI in acute stroke patients in the literature.
METHODS:
We collected 41 patients (26 male, 15 female), including different infarctions with acute cerebral infarction in different brain regions. Of all patients, 20 were single-infarction, while others were multi-infarctions. In this paper, we categorized acute cerebral infarction lesions into two types according to the parametric characteristics of both DKI and DWI. Type I means the DKI and DWI were matched, and Type II means the DKI and DWI were mismatched. Based on each parametric map, the region of interest (ROI) is outlined in each most severe lesion area (as large as possible in the center of the lesion). In the control group, ROIs of the same size are located in the corresponding regions of the contralateral hemisphere.
RESULTS:
In both Type I and Type II, all parameters conform to a normal distribution. An independent sample T-test was used to compare the differences between each group. In Type I, we found the FA, MD, Da, Dr, MK and Ka values were statistically different (
P<
P
<

CONCLUSION:
DKI, compared to DWI, can provide more imaging information about intracranial ischemic infarction, which can deepen the understanding of the mechanism of ischemic tissue damage. Our classification of the brain acute stroke lesions by DKI parameters and DWI may help us rediscover the real core of infraction.",non-technical,-,

The introduction of this hematocrit for the latter purpose, in spite of the fact that a great variety of sedimentation tubes is already available, is justified because this instrument may be employed with little additional effort for the other purposes mentioned and because the sedimentation rate may, by the determination of the volume of packed red cells in the same instrument, be very readily corrected for degree of anemia.

The first set of investigation consisted of applying the univariate logistic regression (ULR), Spearman's correlation and AUC (Area under ROC curve) analysis on four PROMISE datasets. This investigation evaluated the capability of each metric to predict fault proneness, when used in isolation. The second set of experiments consisted of applying the four machine learning techniques on the next two subsequent versions of the same project datasets to validate the effectiveness of the metrics. Based on the results of individual performance of metrics, we used only those metrics that are found significant, to build multivariate prediction models. Next, we evaluated the significant metrics related to design attributes both in isolation and in combination to validated their capability of predicting fault proneness. Our results suggested that models built on coupling and complexity metrics are better and more accurate than those built on using the rest of metrics",non-technical,-,

"Background: The momentum of robotic surgery is increasing, and it has great prospects in pancreatic surgery. It has been widely accepted and expanding to more and more centers. Robotic distal pancreatectomy (RDP) is the most recent advanced minimally invasive approach for pancreatic lesions and malignancies. However, laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy (LDP) also showed good efficacy. We compared the effect of RDP with LDP using a meta-analysis.
Methods: From January 2010 to June 2023, clinical trials of RDP versus LDP were determined by searching PubMed, Medline, and EMBASE. A meta-analysis was conducted to compare the effect of RDP with LDP. This meta-analysis evaluated the R0 resection rate, lymph node metastasis rate, conversion to open surgery rate, spleen preservation rate, intraoperative blood loss, postoperative pancreatic fistula, postoperative hospital stay, 90-day mortality rate, surgical cost, and total cost.
Results: This meta-analysis included 38 studies. Conversion to open surgery, blood loss, and 90-day mortality in the RDP group were all significantly less than that in the LDP group (P < .05). There was no difference in lymph node resection rate, R0 resection rate, or postoperative pancreatic fistula between the two groups (P > .05). Spleen preservation rate in the LDP group was higher than that in the RDP group (P < .05). Operation cost and total cost in the RDP group were both more than that in the LDP group (P < .05). It is uncertain which group has an advantage in postoperative hospital stay.
Conclusions: To some degree, RDP and LDP were indeed worth comparing in clinical practice. However, it may be difficult to determine which is absolute advantage according to current data. Large sample randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm which is better treatment.",non-technical,-,
"Cognitive dysfunction represents a core deficit in schizophrenia, and a number of studies (Green, 1996; Green et al., 2000) illustrate how cognitive deficits may strongly influence the clinical presentation and daily functioning of people with this illness. Cognitive therapy based on the concept that the way we think about things affects how we feel emotionally. Cognitive restructuring (CR) can be thought as if an umbrella term for a variety of cognitive-based approaches aimed at reducing negative automatic thoughts and ameliorating maladaptive schemas. Present study is aimed to reduce cognitive errors and improved attribution style in the patients with schizophrenia using cognitive restructuring therapy. Method: Selected Five (5) patient having Schizophrenia according to ICD-10 DCR from different inpatient department from Tertiary mental health care setup were analysed using the simple random sampling technique.

"Education is one of the key pillars that foster social and economic developments in both developed and third world countries. Adult education signifies any form of learning undertaken by men and women who are no longer involved in formal education and who improve themselves by increasing their knowledge, skills and attitudes through organized activities in a non-formal set up. This programme is especially made for them so that they can get knowledge at any stage of life. Basic Adult Education (BAE) was established in 1979 with the aim of eradicating illiteracy and paving way for economic development. However, the road to success in implementation of BAE has been met by many challenges pedagogical issues cited as one of the major road blocks. The purpose of this study was to investigate the extent to which teaching methods affect implementation of BAE in Mumias District of Kakamega County. The descriptive survey design was applied in the study. A sample of 32 purposely selected adult teachers and 553 learners selected through stratified sampling was surveyed through questionnaires for both qualitative and quantitative data which were analyzed and presented in tables of frequencies, percentages and figures. Key findings revealed that although there was a curriculum supported by teachers and learning resources, teaching methods used did not factor the age of the learners and their mastery ability. Practical oriented materials were not available forcing teachers to rely heavily on traditional method of content delivery. The study was significant in so far as it added value to BAE by availing useful data for improvement of quality standards towards realization of objectives of adult education. It was recommended that BAE teachers through the Ministry of Education should be inducted on effective methods of content delivery that will enable adults meet their objectives in their learning centers.

"Background and aims
At present, it is difficult and risky to diagnose splenic lesions by conventional needle biopsy using computed tomography (CT) or ultrasound (US). Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided tissue acquisition is increasingly being used as a new technique to determine the tissue diagnosis of splenic lesions. Therefore, our goal was to determine the efficacy and safety of EUS-guided tissue acquisition for splenic lesions.
Methods
We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the pooled sensitivity and specificity of EUS-guided tissue acquisition for the diagnosis of splenic lesions using Metadisc. The Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies Questionnaire, a quality assessment tool, was used to scrutinize the quality of the studies.
Results
Six eligible studies between January 2000 and June 2022 were identified, and a total number of 62 patients (aged range from 19 to 84) were enrolled. One patient was excluded because of insufficient specimens. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of included studies were 0.85 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.73–0.93] and 0.77 (95% CI, 0.46–0.95), respectively. The pooled positive likelihood ratio (LR) was 2.38 (95% CI, 1.24–4.57), the pooled negative LR was 0.31 (95% CI, 0.17–0.55), the pooled diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) was 8.67 (95% CI, 2.80–26.82), the area under the summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curve was 0.8100 (Standard Error 0.0813).
Conclusion
EUS-guided tissue acquisition is a safe technique with high sensitivity in the diagnosis of splenic lesions. However, because of the small sample sizes, more studies with more cases are needed to further validate these results.",non-technical,-,

"Many clinical trials and experimental studies claim that sham acupuncture is as effective as traditional Chinese acupuncture. However, these studies have no standard sham acupuncture control and many other factors can affect the clinical effect. These factors include needle retention time, treatment frequency, and the total number of treatments needed for satisfactory results, and all can change the clinical effect. The majority of existing acupuncture treatment studies do not consider these factors and lack standard dosage criteria. Therefore, it is still too early to conclude that sham acupuncture is as effective as traditional Chinese acupuncture. This article investigates the factors that influence the curative effect of acupuncture as to help set a standard for acupuncture studies in the future.

It includes the documentation of the gold-washing processes and the tools. It also includes a historical account of gold-acquiring and gold-washing in this area. Further it compares gold-acquiring techniques with other regions of the world. An important question that is discussed in this paper is about the dark future of this profession here. The first threat to this profession was its being considered unholy (having no barakah or unblessed) by the locals. The construction of Bhasha-dam has become now a real threat to the existence of this profession. The construction of Bhash-dam will not only sink their many villages, it will further bring under water all the sites where they wash gold. The problem is not only that they will loose houses and working places (livelihood). They will hardly be entitled to any compensation because they are not considered indigenous by others population groups living here. This article proves with the help of historical literature that gold-washing is one of the oldest known professions in this area.

"During the past decades, there has been an extensive attention in using Ultra-High Performance Concrete (UHPC) in the buildings and infrastructures construction. Due to that, defining comprehensive mechanical properties of UHPC required to design structural members is worthwhile. The main difference of UHPC with the conventional concrete is the very high strength of UHPC, resulting designing elements with less weight and smaller sizes. However, there have been no globally accepted UHPC properties to be implemented in the designing process. Therefore, in the current study, the UHPC mechanical properties such as compressive and tensile strength, modulus of elasticity and development length for designing purposes are provided based on the reviewed literature. According to that, the best-recommended properties of UHPC that can be used in designing of UHPC members are summarized.

"The accelerated development of network technology and internet applications has increased the significance of protecting digital data and images from unauthorized access and manipulation. The secret image-sharing network (SIS) is a crucial technique used to protect private digital photos from illegal editing and copying. SIS can be classified into two types: single-secret sharing (SSS) and multi-secret sharing (MSS). In SSS, a single secret image is divided into multiple shares, while in MSS, multiple secret images are divided into multiple shares. Both SSS and MSS ensure that the original secret images cannot be reconstructed without the correct combination of shares. Therefore, several secret image-sharing methods have been developed depending on these two methods for example visual cryptography, steganography, discrete wavelet transform, watermarking, and threshold. All of these techniques are capable of randomly dividing the secret image into a large number of shares, each of which cannot provide any information to the intrusion team. This study examined various visual secret-sharing schemes as unique examples of participant secret-sharing methods. Several structures that generalize and enhance VSS were also discussed in this study on covert image-sharing protocols and also this research also gives a comparative analysis of several methods based on various attributes in order to better concentrate on the future directions of the secret image. Generally speaking, the image quality generated employing developed methodologies is preferable to the image quality achieved through using the traditional visual secret-sharing methodology.",non-technical,-,

"Background: The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mediates vasculogenesis and angiogenesisthrough promoting endothelial cell growth, migration and mitosis, and has involvement in cancer pathogenesis,progression and metastasis. However, the prognostic value of VEGF in patients with prostate cancer remainscontroversial. 
Objectives: The aim of our study was to evaluate the prognostic value of VEGF in prostate cancer,and summarise the results of related research on VEGF. 
Methods: In accordance with an established searchstrategy, 11 studies with 1,529 patients were included in our meta-analysis. The correlation of VEGF-expressionwith overall survival and progression-free survival was evaluated by hazard ratio, either given or calculated.
Results: The studies were categorized by introduction of the author, demographic data in each study, prostatecancer-relatived information, VEGF cut-off value, VEGF subtype, methods of hazard ratio (HR) estimationand its 95% confidence interval (CI). High VEGF-expression in prostate cancer is a poor prognostic factor withstatistical significance for OS (HR=2.32, 95%CI: 1.40–3.24). However, high VEGF-expression showed no effecton poor PFS (HR=1.30, 95%CI: 0.88–1.72). Using Begg’s, Egger’s test and funnel plots, we confirmed lack ofpublication bias in our analysis.

"Background
The effectiveness of platelet concentrates in promoting root development of necrotic immature permanent teeth is unclear. The present study evaluated whether the platelet concentrate protocol was superior to the traditional blood clot protocol in regeneration therapy.
Methods
We searched Electronic databases, such as PubMed, Cochrane Library, ClinicalTrials and EMBASE. Randomized controlled trial studies, cohort studies, case-control studies and cross-sectional studies were included, in which platelet-rich concentrates were tested for periapical healing and root development, with the blood clot treatment protocol as the control group. Clinical and radiographic outcomes were considered. Selected articles were assessed for risk of bias. Pooled risk ratios (risk ratio, RR) were calculated for clinical success, responses to cold and electric pulp tests, periapical lesions, apex closure, root lengthening, and thickening of the dentin walls. Subgroup meta-analysis were conducted according to the type of platelet concentrate used.
Results
Of the 1272 screened studies, 13 randomized controlled studies, 2 case-control studies and 1 cohort study were selected, in which 465 immature necrotic permanent teeth, particularly incisors and premolars, were treated. Of these 465 teeth, 457 (98.2%) in both the control and experimental groups remained clinically asymptomatic for the entire study duration, whereas eight (1.8%) showed signs and symptoms of failure, including spontaneous pain, sensitivity to percussion or reinfection. Compared with control teeth, teeth treated with PRP achieved better apical healing than BC group (RR 1.13, 95% CI 1.01–1.26, P = 0.03), and teeth treated with platelet concentrates showed improved apical closure (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.86–1.25, P = 0.69), root lengthening (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.74–1.39, P = 0.93), and thickening of the dentin walls (RR 1.35, 95% CI 0.95–1.93, P = 0.09), although these differences were not statistically significant.
Conclusions
Platelet concentrates can be used as successful scaffolds for regenerative endodontic treatment of necrotic immature permanent teeth, and PRP as a scaffold may achieve better periapical healing of teeth with periapical inflammation, although they did not differ significantly from conventional blood clot scaffolds in development of the root.",non-technical,-,

"Objective. Multi-phase computed tomography (CT) has become a leading modality for identifying hepatic tumors. Nevertheless, the presence of misalignment in the images of different phases poses a challenge in accurately identifying and analyzing the patient's anatomy. Conventional registration methods typically concentrate on either intensity-based features or landmark-based features in isolation, so imposing limitations on the accuracy of the registration process. Method. We establish a nonrigid cycle-registration network that leverages semi-supervised learning techniques, wherein a point distance term based on Euclidean distance between registered landmark points is introduced into the loss function. Additionally, a cross-distillation strategy is proposed in network training to further improve registration performance which incorporates response-based knowledge concerning the distances between feature points. Results. We conducted experiments using multi-centered liver CT datasets to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. The results demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline methods in terms of target registration error. Additionally, Dice scores of the warped tumor masks were calculated. Our method consistently achieved the highest scores among all the comparing methods. Specifically, it achieved scores of 82.9% and 82.5% in the hepatocellular carcinoma and the intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma dataset, respectively. Significance. The superior registration performance indicates its potential to serve as an important tool in hepatic tumor identification and analysis.",non-technical,-,

In Malaysia the lack of awareness compliance of buffer zone implementation for urban development of the housing may have to nestle within industrial establishment. Industrial activities often cause environmental problems such as excessive noise levels and poor air quality, which is turn affect the natural environment, health and comforts of life in the residential-industrial neighbourhood. This paper reports the findings regarding the buffer zone implementation in residential-industrial neighbourhood. This paper reviews the comparison data of noise level measurement in the residential area with and without buffer zone. The experimental method is carried out to measure the noise level in the residential area which is having buffer zone and without buffer zone. The data will analysis by using the Microsoft Excel to get the average of noise produced. It responds to the lack of environmental policies for housing development in residential- industrial areas in Malaysia. The ongoing development of this research will eventually lead to increase the awareness among the construction industry players for promoting the use of buffer zone implementation guidelines in these residential areas.",non-technical,-,
"In current time, there are different techniques used to create 3D models of soil surface such photogrammetric and Laser scanning techniques. Although, these techniques are efficient for capturing 3D soil models of a small area, they will be inefficient with increasing the captured area because of the increase in the cost and in the processing time. Thus, in this study an economic, fast, efficient videogrammetric system is developed for capturing 3D soil models. The new system consists of two mobile cameras and LED lights. The system is fixed on a car and used for capturing stereo video clips of soil surfaces of the selected study area when the car was moving. Stereo images are extracted from stereo video clips with the assistance of LED lights that was used for synchronization. A Agisoft Metashape software is used to create 3D models of soil surface based on stereo images. The results show that the accuracy of the produced 3D Models is within (RMSExyz = ± 10 cm). In conclusion, the developed videogrammeric system can provide a precise, fast and low-cost 3D model of soil surface.",non-technical,-,

"The purpose of this thesis was to explore what kind of confidence nursing degree students obtain about prevention of hospital-acquired infections caused by bacterial pathogens. The objective of this study was to raise nursing degree students’ awareness on self-protection and self-prevention of hospital-acquired infections during practical training and at work after graduation. The research question in this study was: what measures do nursing students need to take into account in regards to hospital-acquired infection prevention? 

The knowledge base was included three precise principal data resources, such as THL, WHO, PMID, to build the theoretical framework. The method applied for this study was quantitative research method, following by the conduction of a survey. The survey was given to the certain group of students from Laurea. 

The main results of this study were to evaluate Laurea UAS’s nursing degree students’ own knowledge and comprehensive understanding about the preventive measurement of hospital-acquired infections. Based on the results, the further outcome of this study was to provide a newest guide of self-prevention for nursing degree students. To be more specific, the guide was created as an informative and picturable poster, which contains all recommendations required for prevention of getting infection. 

The analysis of the results demonstrated that approximately 80% of Laurea UAS’s nursing degree students had been provided adequate knowledge about bacterial hospital-acquired infections during practice at healthcare facilities. More importantly, 50 out of 51 respondents have had the adequate level of confidence on performing hand hygiene appropriately equal or more than 50%. Besides that, there are some barriers that hinder students from performing hand hygiene and asepsis adequately. About half of nursing degree respondents had chosen ‘they forget doing it’ as their answers. 

In conclusion, the figures from this study’s findings generally showed that nursing degree students had deeply educated about the essentiality of infection prevention at Laurea UAS and at practice placement. Recommendations of this study are that it is strongly believed hand hygiene and asepsis play a vital role in healthcare professionals’ career. For this reason, nursing degree students are necessarily provided information about hygiene-performing procedures promptly when they are freshmen. Additionally, authors’ recommendation for further researches are that this study’s topic-related and the poster about hand hygiene guideline will be made in Finnish in the future. Therefore, the results will be not only applied for nursing degree program in English but also in Finnish. ",non-technical,-,
"The problem of improving quality of higher education arose long ago. Many higher education institutions have been working at this issue since last century, developing innovative ways to improve quality of education. Since today’s approaches and spheres of assessment are different, the solution to the problem is rather complicated. After Russia’s joining the Bologna process, quality of higher education became rather a pointed question. Participation in the process does not imply obligatory standardization of higher education, but it shows intention to compare higher education in different countries. Comparability of educational systems is based both on actions linked to changes of higher education structure (introduction of two- level education, credit system, etc.) and measures defining education quality (quality control, using new education standards, introducing innovative methods of students’ preparation and Learning Management System). This article considers the way to improve higher education quality via innovative teaching methods. Besides, the article introduces an overview of active and interactive teaching methods, integrative teaching approaches, examples of their implementation when teaching business subjects, and some statistics of using the methods described.",non-technical,-,
"This study summarizes gas flow process in unconventional porous rocks, including the transportation in tight or shale reservoirs and the spontaneous imbibition happened in them. Fluids flow is greatly affected by the pore structure together with the pore size distribution of porous media. The MRI and BET measurement show peaks in pore throat radius ranging from 2 to 20 nm, whereas the diameter for methane and helium are 0.38 and 0.26 nm, respectively. Yet for different types of reservoir, distinct mechanisms should be utilized based on the flow regimes. Besides, experimental measurement techniques for conventional reservoirs are no long accurate enough for most of the unconventional reservoirs. New attempts have been implemented to obtain more valuable data for accurate reservoir prediction. By reviewing large numbers of articles, a clear and comprehensive map on the gas flow and recovery in unconventional reservoirs is made. Factors influencing the gas flow and recovery are investigated in detail for mathematical simulation process. Reservoir conditions and the sweep efficiency play an important role during gas production process. Besides, adsorbed gas contributes a lot to the total gas recovery. The overall investigations suggest that many parameters that influence the gas flow in unconventional porous rocks should be taken into consideration during the evaluation. Among them, permeability, adsorbed gas dynamics, stimulated reservoir volume as well as the unstimulated reservoir volume, and imbibition effect are the most important ones. This study provides valuable data and reasonable exploitations for characterizing gas flow and recovery in unconventional porous rocks.",non-technical,-,

"Complex traits, i.e. those with multiple genetic and environmental determinants, represent the greatest challenge for genetic analysis, largely due to the difficulty of isolating the effects of any one gene amid the noise of other genetic and environmental influences. Methods exist for detecting and mapping the Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs) that influence complex traits. However, once mapped, gene identification commonly involves reduction of focus to single candidate genes or isolated chromosomal regions. To reach the next level in unraveling the genetics of human disease will require moving beyond the focus on one gene at a time, to explorations of pleiotropism, epistasis and environment-dependency of genetic effects. Genetic interactions and unique environmental features must be as carefully scrutinized as are single gene effects. No one genetic approach is likely to possess all the necessary features for comprehensive analysis of a complex disease. Rather, the entire arsenal of behavioral genomic and other approaches will be needed, such as random mutagenesis, QTL analyses, transgenic and knockout models, viral mediated gene transfer, pharmacological analyses, gene expression assays, antisense approaches and importantly, revitalization of classical genetic methods. In our view, classical breeding designs are currently underutilized, and will shorten the distance to the target of understanding the complex genetic and environmental interactions associated with disease. We assert that unique combinations of classical approaches with current behavioral and molecular genomic approaches will more rapidly advance the field.",non-technical,-,
"Tea is one of the most important cash crops in Bangladesh, playing a significant role in food security, poverty alleviation, employment, and the economy. As a rain-fed crop, tea cultivation depends on micro-climatic conditions for optimal growth. Bangladesh observed extreme weather and climate events over the last couple of decades. Bangladesh is experiencing the frequency of climate variations and extreme weather events, like prolonged drought, heavy rainfall, and late winter spells. The study area was carried out at Malnicherra tea estate in Sylhet district to correlate the micro-climatic variables to tea productivity. The study also examines the trend of micro-climatic variables like maximum temperature, minimum temperature, and rainfall by using the time series data from 2012 to 2017. The simple linear regressions reveal that temperature and rainfall influence tea production. Tea production was negatively impacted by drought and excessive rainfall. Heavy rains eroded the top fertile soil and washed away soil nutrients. The yield of tea leaf was declining at the rate of 110.8 kg/ha/year. There was a high negative relationship between mean maximum temperature and yield of tea. The study recommends an integrated adaptive measure to minimize adverse effects.",non-technical,-,
"The study highlights the significance of the Raute community, their unique traditional lifestyle, and the challenges they have faced with. It emphasizes the importance of protecting and supporting marginalized communities like the Raute, as well as the need for equitable development. The main objective of the study is to identify the traditional livelihood practices of the Raute tribe in Nepal. The research was carried out in different districts but was focused on the Raute tribe from Gurans Rural Municipality of karnali province in Nepal. This study used descriptive research techniques to look at quantitative and qualitative data from 149 people between the ages of 18 and 65. Purposive sampling was used to interview 70 Raute people in this age group as well as the Raute leader (Mukhiya). To validate qualitative findings, primary and secondary sources were used, as well as informal conversations took place with key persons of local authorities. The study revealed that the Raute tribe, which consists of 149 people and has 48 percent women, frequently, shifts their dwellings and uses building materials from the forest. They rely on government assistance and forest preservation activities for income because they lack formal education and employment. Child marriage, dangerous deliveries, a lack of awareness about family planning, and a dependence on conventional medicine are all causes for concern.

"This study focuses on the occupational component of the labor market adjustment of Hispanic immigrants. The author asks whether Hispanic immigrants assimilate with natives and what factors influence occupational attainment. The findings suggest that years since migration narrow the socioeconomic gap between Hispanic immigrants, their U.S.-born Hispanic counterparts, and non-Hispanic whites. The level of human capital affects the rate of occupational mobility and determines whether convergence occurs in the groups' socioeconomic occupational status. The occupational status of Hispanic immigrants with low human capital remains fairly stable and does not converge with that of non-Hispanic whites. However, those with high human capital experience upward occupational mobility. In part, their occupational assimilation is driven by the acquisition of human capital among younger Hispanic immigrants.",non-technical,-,
"The ecological importance of fallowing to swidden (slash and burn) agriculture is well known. Cyclic agroforestry systems which emphasize utilization of the fallow cycle should, where appropriate, consider the ecologic processess of site recovery, so as not to impair the productivity of the subsequent swidden cycle. this artical discusses the ecologic ‘fit’ of a cyclic swidden-fallow management scheme into swidden cultivation and fallow succession. Such a fit suggests a reciprocally reinforcing situation between this agroforestry design and processes involved in site recovery. Observed among some indigenous and colonist inhabitants of the Peruvian Amazon, this system produces fallow crops and products, while enhancing site nutrient recovery. The economic benefits of this scheme have recently been reported (Denevan and Padoch, n.d.) while the ecologic attributes involved in promoting site recovery have not; primarily these include:
	•			a)
Less destruction of the nutrient cycling root-mat in the swidden cycle, and its quicker re-formation in the fallow cycle.
	•			b)
Discouraging the establishment of exotic, pantropical weeds and grasses such as imperata, while encouraging the colonization of local, early successional species.
	•			c)
Encouraging the earlier establishment of woody plants in abandoned swiddens.
	•			d)
A natural litterfall higher in nutrients than in unmanaged fallows.
	•			e)
Additions of ‘slash’ litterfall higher in nutrient content than natural litterfall in the proximity of valuable managed plants.
	•			f)
The increased capacity of the managed stand to scavenge limiting nutrients such as N and P from, and leach unneeded quantities of non-limiting nutrients such as K, Ca and Mg to, thoughfall.
	•			g)
Increasing the alkalinity of throughfall, possibly resulting in less soil cation leaching in managed fallows.
	•			h)
Staggering seed production, germination and maturation times of the rapid nutrient sycling softwood trees.
	•			i)
Increasing the spontaneously occuring abundance of valuable fallow plants with management of successive fallow cycles, thereby possibly reducing the labor requirement, and increasing the value of this agroforestry scheme over time.

"Association rules mining is one of the most important topic in data mining. The Btree index, a general and compact structure which provides tight integration of item set extraction in a relational DBMS. The Databases may be Relational Databases or Transactional Databases. Since no constraint is enforced during the index creation phase, Btree index provides a whole representation of the original database. The Btree Index creates prefix tree like structure and stores addresses of disk blocks where relational database records are stored. Along with the disk blocks Btree index maintains pointers to disk blocks. Using these pointers it can extracts required data base records from database into main memory and finds corresponding item sets for association rule mining. To reduce the I/O cost, data accessed combine during the same extraction phase are clustered on the same disk block. The Btree index structure can be efficiently exploited by different item set extraction algorithms. The Btree index has been integrated into the SQL SERVER, PostgreSQL, Oracle DBMS and exploits its physical level access methods. Experiments, run for both dense and sparse data distributions, show the efficiency of the proposed index and its linear scalability also for large data sets.",non-technical,-,

"The dynamics of concentration fluctuations of polystyrene (M W = 20,000) in cyclohexane is studied as a function of temperature and concentration using the photon correlation spectroscopic technique. Over a 60°C temperature range the translational diffusion coefficient D C changes by more than two orders of magnitude. At a given temperature, D C first decreases with increasing concentration until a critical concentration C* at 22% is reached, beyond which D C increases with increasing concentration, reaching a maximum at higher concentration. The critical concentration C* is insensitive to temperature variations and can be estimated according to the equation for overlap concentration. The scattering intensity measurement as a function of concentration also shows a maximum at C*, suggesting that the slow down of concentration fluctuations due to the decrease in(∂u/∂c)P.T. is responsible for the intensity maximum. It is concluded that the emergence of the cooperative motion of the entangled network at C* is closely related to the effects of critical phenomena observed at the cloud point and the slow-down of translational diffusion.

It concludes that while the application of more systematic forms of skill and job measurement has improved the relative rewards of nursery nurses, gendered constructions of their caring skills contaminate evaluation of their educational role such that undervaluation of their work persists. This finding raises implications for other work that incorporates caring skills.

"The solubility is amount of solute which is dissolved in solvent to form a solution below a particular situation of gravity / pressure and temperature. But mainly the API (Active pharmaceutical ingredient) are poorly aqueous soluble (hydrophobic). The solubility, property of the drug becomes one of the most challenging aspect in the formulation development. Poor aqueous solubility may result in the finishing of final product and can result in decrease in its full potential and therapeutical range. Hence improvement of aqueous solubility in such a case is valuable goal to improve therapeutical efficacy. Molecules that would have highly beneficial effect on their physiological target would not be further developed if their bioavailability is limited by their solubility in water. The API / usable pharmaceuticals with poor solubility must be answered well by solubilization techniques such as chemical modification such as salt formation, co-crystallization and more, physical modification such as conventional method, modification of the crystal habit such as polymorphs, complexation such as physical mixture and more, Inclusion complex formulation base techniques such as kneading method and more, solubilization by surfactants such as self emulsifying drug delivery systemand more, drug dispersion in carries such as solid solutions and more, pH adjustment, supercritical fluid process, liquisolid technique, and polymeric alteration. The contribution of this article is to combine all the techniques which can enhance the solubility of drug.",non-technical,-,

"In this paper, we present an image restoration algorithm that uses multiple captured degraded, low resolution (LR) and noisy images to reconstruct a high resolution (HR) image. For the reconstruction process, a spectral-based blind image deconvolution/restoration technique is proposed. The presented mathematical analysis for the technique is carried out in the frequency domain. The developed analysis is then used to estimate captured images' spectra that are needed for the blind restoration algorithm. Unlike conventional image restoration methods, our spectral-based algorithm: (i) significantly minimizes the effects introduced by additive noise (ii) does not use inverse filtering, which can be unstable, (iii) is efficient in computation complexity when compared to previously reported methods. The proposed algorithm is tested on multiple blurred, LR and noisy medical images. Results show that the proposed algorithm is capable of restoring HR images from degraded observations even at low signal-to-noise energy ratios (SNERs).",non-technical,-,
"Background:
Ranking of interventions is one of the most appealing elements of network meta-analysis. There is, however, little evidence about the reliability of these rankings.
Purpose:
To empirically evaluate the extent of uncertainty in intervention rankings from network meta-analysis.
Data Sources:
Two previous systematic reviews that involved searches of the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, and Embase up to July 2012 for articles that included networks of at least 3 interventions.
Study Selection:
58 network meta-analyses involving 1308 randomized trials and 404 interventions with available aggregated outcome data.
Data Analysis:
Each network was analyzed with a Bayesian approach. For each intervention, the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) and its 95% credible interval (95% CrI) were estimated. Through use of the SUCRA values, the interventions were then rank-ordered between 0% (worst) and 100% (best).
Data Synthesis:
The median width of the 95% CrIs of the SUCRA was 65% (first to third quartile, 38% to 80%). In 28% of networks, there was a 50% or greater probability that the best-ranked treatment was actually not the best. No evidence showed a difference between the best-ranked intervention and the second and third best-ranked interventions in 90% and 71% of comparisons, respectively. In 39 networks with 6 or more interventions, the median probability that 1 of the top 2 interventions was among the bottom 2 was 35% (first to third quartile, 14% to 59%).
Limitation:
This analysis did not consider such factors as the risk of bias within trials or small-study effects that may affect the reliability of rankings.
Conclusion:
Treatment rankings derived from network meta-analyses have a substantial degree of imprecision. Authors and readers should interpret such rankings with great caution.",non-technical,-,
"Organ transplantation is a medical practice dates back to the 1920s and has led to tens of thousands of lives being saved. Currently, there is a massive shortage of organs suitable for donation in the United States with more than 114,000 men, women, and children on the organ waiting list, with less than 20,000 registered donors (Department of Health and Human Services, 2019). This paper covers the history of organ donation, where the issue of the lack of organs currently stands, and the role communication plays in carrying out one’s choice to donate. Understanding these factors has led to a health campaign plan based on a template created by George Washington University. The goal of the plan is to aid in increasing formal conversation between young adults and their next of kin about organ donation choices and the decision making process, so that the next of kin will be more likely to make the choice consistent with the young adults’ decisions concerning their organs",non-technical,-,
"This paper presents the development of a Twin-T oscillator comprising polymer coated parallel plates as a sensor for ocean water salinity monitoring. This sensor employs a parallel plate capacitor design, with sea water serving as the medium between plates. Novalac resin and a proprietary commercial polymer (Accuflo™) were investigated as corrosion protective coatings for the copper electrodes of the capacitor. Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) was employed to evaluate corrosion inhibition of polymer coating in sea water. A detection circuit was designed and simulated using P-spice and then implemented in Printed Circuit Board (PCB). EIS results indicate that Accuflo exhibits better corrosion inhibition in ocean water than Novolac. Further, the use of Twin-T oscillator based detection circuit resulted in enhanced sensitivity and better detection limit. Experiments performed using ocean water samples resulted in oscillator frequency shift of 410 Hertz/power supply unit (Hz/PSU). Oscillator frequency drift was reduced using frequency-to-voltage converters and sensitivity of 10 mV/PSU was achieved.",non-technical,-,
"This study reports a comprehensive review on drought indices used in monitoring meteorological, agricultural, hydrological, and socio-economic drought. Drought indices have been introduced as an important approach to quantitative and qualitative calculations of drought’s severity and impact. There were 111 drought indices reviewed in this study, which fall into two categories: traditional (location-specific/model) and remote sensing (RS). Out of 111 indices, 44 belong to the traditional indices and 67 belong to the RS section. This study shows that meteorological drought monitoring has the highest number (22) of traditional indices, about 20% overall, while the lowest (7) agricultural drought monitoring is 6.3%. The specialty is that when considering remote sensing-based drought indices, 90% are used for agricultural drought monitoring and 10% for hydrological and meteorological drought monitoring. However, the study found that advances in satellite technology have accelerated the design of new drought indices and that replacing traditional location-specific data with satellite observation makes it easier to calculate more spatial distribution and resolution.",non-technical,-,
"Background: Noonan syndrome (NS) is a rare group of autosomal genetic disorders. In recent years, with the exploration and development of molecular diagnostic techniques, more and more researchers have begun to pay attention to NS. However, there is still a lack of reports on the bibliometric analysis of NS worldwide. This study aims to assess the current research status and development trend of NS, to explore the research hotspots and emerging topics, and to point out the direction for future scientific research.
Methods: Web of Science Core Collection was selected as the search database for bibliometric analysis of NS-related publications from 1998 to 2023. Statistical and visual analysis of the number of publications, countries, institutions, authors, journals, keywords, and references were analyzed using Citespace, VOSviewer, Scimago Graphica, and BibliometrixR.
Results: A total of 2041 articles were included in this study. The United States had the highest number of publications, and Istituto Superiore di Sanità, Italy, was the institution with the highest number of publications. TARTAGLIA M was the scientist with the highest number of publications and citations.

Future research efforts will explore more deeply from the perspective of long-term intervention strategies for NS. There is an urgent need to rely on significant research countries, institutions, journals, and authors to lead the construction of a more robust global collaborative network that will enhance research efficacy",non-technical,-,
"This paper presents a study on the flexural behavior of Ultra-High-Performance Fiber-Reinforced Concrete (UHPFRC) beams, which included conventional reinforcing bars. The study focuses on critical design aspects, such as concrete shrinkage and cracking implications on the tension-stiffening phenomenon. An experimental program with two different sized flexural reinforced UHPFRC beams was run. Beams were cast and tested in a four-point bending test (4PBT) using UHPFRC with different amounts of fibers: 130 and 160 kg/m3 (1.66% and 2.00% in vol.) to cover a wide range of strain-softening and strain-hardening constitutive UHPFRC behaviors. A non-linear finite element model (NLFEM) was developed to validate the mechanical tensile characterization of UHPFRC when applied to reinforced elements. Both shrinkage and tension-stiffening effects were considered to improve the model. After the NLFEM simulation, very reliable results were obtained at both the service and ultimate load levels compared to the experimental ones. Finally, some aspects about the design of reinforced UHPFRC cross-sections under bending forces are addressed and satisfactorily compared to the experimental results.

"Objectives: Irrigation and debridement constitute an important part of treatment of open fractures. We investigated the efficiency of different irrigation methods and durations in cleansing contaminated bovine femur cancellous bone samples and the extent of tissue damage associated with irrigation.
Methods: A total of 72 samples of 4x4x1 cm size were obtained from fresh frozen bovine distal femoral cancellous bone. The top surface of the samples were sawed to a 2-mm depth to create four squares equal in size. All the samples were contaminated with construction sand using the same method and were then randomized to three irrigation groups (bulb syringe irrigation, high pressure pulsatile lavage, and low-pressure pulsatile lavage), each consisting of 24 samples. The duration of irrigation was set as 3, 6, or 9 minutes for every eight samples of each group. After the irrigation procedure, the images were transferred to a computer screen with a video-microscope camera and the number of sand particles on the samples were counted and irrigation-related macroscopic bone damage was assessed.
Results: The lowest number of sand particles was found on the samples irrigated by high-pressure pulsatile lavage (p<0.001). The duration of irrigation did not affect the efficiency of cleansing in all the groups (p>0.05). The least irrigation-related bone damage was observed in samples irrigated by low-pressure pulsatile lavage for 3 minutes (p<0.01). The amount of bone damage was similar in all groups after irrigations beyond 3 minutes (p>0.05).
Conclusion: Our findings showed that the most efficient method of cleansing contaminated bone samples was high-pressure pulsatile lavage and that prolonged irrigations did not enhance the efficiency of the irrigation method; however, high-pressure irrigation of 3 minute duration resulted in the greatest bone damage.

"This study assessed the role of journalism training institutions in the changing media dynamics of Tanzania. Journalism training institutions are accredited higher learning facilities that offer diploma and degree certifications to those who graduate respectively after a two-to-three-year course of professional training in journalism in Tanzania. Media dynamics refers to the prevalent environment surrounding the media performance in Tanzania. These range from the media laws, policies, the regulatory frameworks, ownership, media pluralism, media diversity, market preferences and communication technologies. This paper is derived from the findings of a research dissertation submitted for award of a Doctorate degree in Mass Communication at St Augustine University of Tanzania. The study employed a descriptive survey design. A mixed method approach was employed to collect data from four news editors from two prominent media houses (Tanzania Broadcasting Corporation and Mwananchi Communications), six working journalists, four journalism lecturers and 150 journalism students from St. Augustine University of Tanzania Malimbe Campus. Interview data was thematically analysed and presented in a narrative form while the survey data was analysed using descriptive statistics with the help of SPSS version 23 and presented in tables, charts, and diagrams. The findings showed that, owing to the fast-paced technological advancement in the media houses, graduating journalists could not adapt smoothly in the newsroom. Moreover, the constant changes in media policies engineered mostly by political pressures were not communicated to the training institutions. Although the training institutions are competent and sufficiently equipped still, they cannot invest in the constant technological shift like in the media. This study recommends that stakeholders employ an intense collaborative effort to bridge the training to industry, such that journalism students are more engaged in a practical media experience during their course of study. Media houses should facilitate field attachment training opportunities to students in order for them to stay abreast of the current technological changes in their profession",non-technical,-,
"Background: The impact of the COVID-19 disease on air travel has been dramatic. Stringent infection prevention and control measures are vital to reduce the risk of both symptomatic and asymptomatic in-flight transmission. This is a retrospective description of the prevention and control measures in flight. With the introduction of the COVID-19 vaccine, the measures should be adjusted.

Methods and Results: As infection control professional medical staff, the main authors of the article participated in the development of infection prevention and control measures and procedures on international flights. We initially proposed a series of countermeasures to the COVID-19 pandemic in flight on the basis of the experience of infection prevention and control in the hospital and the guideline from the Civil Aviation Administration of China, which involving rating COVID-19 symptoms by scanning a QR code to identify suspected patients, principles of diet preparation, avoiding the peak time of dinning during flight and management of lavatory. Some of the measures we had mentioned have appeared in the new version of the guideline, which proves their effectiveness. As we learn more about how vaccines will affect the spread of COVID-19, also discuss the adjustment of measures when vaccination coverage increases.

Conclusions: A clear understanding of epidemiological evidence is of great importance in prevent transmissions. Combined use of vaccines with non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to reduce the relative risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 will enable a safe transition to achieving herd immunity. This study offer new ideas for infection prevention and control in flight in the COVID-19 vaccine passport era.",non-technical,-,

"Insufficient landuse planning has accelerated the impact of desertification disasters. By 2050 decertification will lead over 700 million people to migrate from rural areas to crowded cities (UNUESH, 2014). In context, Siwa oasis is one of the threatened cities in Egypt. Urban ecology is a one of the recent approaches in city planning, using ecological science perception, methodology and applications that could help understand cities' behaviour under any environmental shocks.
This paper highlights the role of urban ecology in the maintenance of lands facing natural disasters including degradation taking into consideration the communities' perspective. It sheds light to the vulnerability status of land degradation hazard of Siwian communities in the Egyptian desert. This approach focuses on exploring and evaluating the citizens' awareness of their dynamic nature and the role of individuals to maximise their resilience, and their adaptive capacity towards desertification. Observations and questionnaires were designed in order to examine the severity of negative effect from desertification using the adaptive capacity and vulnerability variables. The data generated from the fieldwork showed a power struggle between education, culture and communication. Involving the community in urban solutions can minimise the effect of desertification and increase their resilience mechanism to land degradation regime.

Pyrene butyric acid (PBA) is a well studied lumophore for its exciting fluorescent properties. The current study focussed on a dendritic modification of PBA with hyperbranched polyglycerols (HPG) by Steglich esterification and further doping with iron oxide nanoparticles (IONP) of α-Fe2O3 phase. The covalent coupling between HPG and PBA was confirmed by FTIR and 1H-NMR spectra. The main objective of the study was to monitor the fluorescent properties of the modified and doped products. Steady state PL emission studies showed a considerable decrease in fluorescence intensity on HPG modification which almost completely disappeared on doping with IONP. This suggests that this fluorosensing property can be explored in identification and estimation of iron oxide nanoparticles which has a great significance in biomedical field both in diagnostics and therapeutics.

"This paper mainly concerns about the problem of estimation of the Riemann-Liouville fractional derivative of arbitrarily bounded continuous signal. By using sliding mode technique, a nonlinear fractional-order derivative estimator of a bounded continuous signal for the order α between 0 and 1 is proposed firstly. Then it is extended to the case of arbitrary order α ∈ R , and the corresponding estimation scheme is also established. The convergence of the presented estimator is discussed in more detail with the assistance of frequency distributed model of the Riemann-Liouville fractional calculus. Meanwhile the matching closed-loop plant is asymptotically stable. The major advantages of the proposed methodology can not only adaptively estimate the Riemann-Liouville fractional derivative of a given signal that is not clear about the upper bound of fractional derivative itself in advance, but also adapt to the uncertain disturbances or stochastic noise environment in system. Numerical simulation results of an example are used to verify the practicality and availability of our given estimation scheme.

" A fast and robust image registration algorithm for high-dimensional brain Magnetic Resonance images was developed based on the statistical deformation models (SDMs). This model learns deformation fields and achieves fast and robust registration by greatly reducing transformation dimensionality. This model is trained via principal component analysis (PCA), which suffers from large transformation dimensionality and small samples. For the high-dimensional image registration, the dimensions of the deformation fields are huge, the basic functions computed from PCA cannot represent deformation fields well. Therefore, we proposed a local SDM (LSDM) in this paper to solve the aforementioned problems. We divided the images into several small parts, in which the dimensions of the deformation fields are greatly reduced. Then, we trained the LSDM using the deformation fields between sample images and a selected template by applying PCA in each small part. Given that the dimension of eigenvectors of LSDM decreases much more than that of SDM, the orthonormal basis functions of LSDM represent the deformation fields more accurately than those of SDM. We obtained the total deformation fields for warping the image by integrating the deformation fields of all LSDMs. Using the manually labeled MR images of different people, we demonstrated that LSDM could greatly reduce the image registration time while maintaining favorable registration accuracy.

"In a research study, a metal-based complex demonstrated anticancer properties. The process involved the synthesis of a compound called 7-chloro-N-[5-(diethylamino)pentan-2-yl]-N-[sulfanyl(carbonothioyl)]quinolyn-4-amine, which incorporated a primaquine-based dithiocarbamate ligand. This synthesis method utilized sodium hydroxide and carbon disulfide at temperatures of 0 to 5°C. Nickel(II), copper(II), and zinc(II) ions were employed as the metal-complexed ligands through various chromatographic and spectroscopic techniques that enhanced their purity. Metal compounds, such as cisplatin and its analogs, were widely used to treat different cancer types. Presently, researchers are exploring alternative metal-based complexes as potential agents against cancer, aiming to mitigate toxic effects linked to medications made of platinum. Investigations conducted in-silico revealed that the ligand preferred interacting with DNA’s minor groove, assembling a single hydrogen bond between an adenine hydrogen atom and the oxygen element of the carbonyl compound in the pyrrolidinone unit. Compared to cisplatin, copper complexes can overcome drug resistance by lowering their toxicity. The findings indicate that these primaquine analogs have the potential to lay the foundation for a novel and efficacious category of cancer chemotherapeutics.

Although such connectivity expands the devices’ ability to fulfill healing and diagnostic functions in a quick and cost-effective manner and can help save many lives, too much reliance on software also results in exposure to several security threats. Control of such devices via the underlying communication network may allow attackers to exploit the critical system vulnerabilities of these devices. Attackers could manipulate the settings of these devices and may try to harm the patients and these malicious attacks can originate from anywhere in the world. However, there have been very few real attempts to hack such devices and harm patients. We investigate the practical security risks involved with the use of IMDs and the motivations for an attacker to hack these devices. While some risks discussed in research are genuine and can be prevented using various security measures, it seems that quite a few risks are mere exaggerations. In our paper, we review the aspects mentioned above of IMDs and also outline some practical security measures that can further enhance the security and privacy for patients using IMDs.",non-technical,-,
"Soil pollution by trace elements (TEs) from mining and industrial activity is widespread and presents a risk to humans and ecosystems. The use of trees to immobilize TEs (phytostabilization) is a low-cost and effective method of soil remediation. We aimed to determine the chemical composition of leaves and flower buds of Eucalyptus camaldulensis in seven sites along the Guadiamar River valley (SW Spain), an area contaminated by a mine-spill in 1998. E. camaldulensis trees in the spill-affected area and adjacent non affected areas were growing on a variety of soils with pH from 5.6 to 8.1 with low concentration of plant nutrients. The spill affected soils contained up to 1069 mg kg-1 of As and 4086 mg kg-1 of Pb. E. camaldulensis tolerated elevated TE concentrations in soil and, compared to other species growing in the same environment, had low TE concentrations in the aerial portions. Besides tolerance to soil contamination, E. camaldulensis had low bioaccumulation coefficients for soil contaminants. TE concentrations in the aboveground portions were below levels reported to be toxic to plants or ecosystems. Flower buds had even lower TE concentrations than leaves. Despite the relatively low concentration of TEs in leaves they were significantly correlated with the soil extractable (0.01 M CaCl2) Cd, Mn and Zn (but not Cu and Pb). The general features of this tree species: tolerance to impoverished and contaminated soils, fast growth and deep root system, and low transfer of TEs from soil to aboveground organs makes it suitable for phytostabilization of soils contaminated by TEs. In addition, eucalyptus leaves could be used for biomonitoring the soil extractability of Cd, Mn and Zn but not Cu or Pb.

"Whilst there is an array of literature written about students’ skills development, there is a gap between skills development and what students can learn through a membership of professional accounting bodies. This study examines how being connected with a professional body, the Association of Chartered and Certified Accountants (ACCA) from the outset of their degree helps awareness of developing their employability skills via belonging to the profession. Using an online questionnaire, focus group meetings, and email reminders about the ACCA services offered, the findings show that ACCA student membership begins to help students identify with the profession and brings awareness to planning and developing both their technical and employability skills, assisting them in entry to the profession and the world of work. The results from this research illuminate the importance of integrating student membership into the curriculum so that students identify early with the career that they have chosen.",non-technical,-,

"Objective. To explore binge eating disorder as a psychological risk factor in patients with obesity seeking bariatric surgery and to determine its predictive value in weight loss outcomes. The aim is to provide a framework for assessing patient risk factors to facilitate early recognition and treatment of binge eating behaviors in order to optimize surgical outcome success. Design. A literature review was performed initially through PubMed and subsequently through reference lists of obtained articles. The search criteria used was the combination of “binge eating,” “obesity,” and “bariatric surgery.” Reference list searches also included studies comparing proposed diagnostic criteria and assessment methods for binge eating disorder. Results. There was sufficient data to support binge eating disorder as a psychological risk factor in obesity. Evidence linking baseline binge eating behavior and bariatric surgery outcomes was inconclusive. There was significant heterogeneity among instruments used to assess binge eating and the definition of binge eating disorder itself varied widely among studies. Conclusion. Overall, there appears to be no consensus on diagnostic criteria for binge eating disorder or for its clinical assessment in bariatric surgery patients. This methodological discordance makes comparing studies of binge eating and surgical outcomes unreliable. As long as there is no universally accepted definition for binge eating disorder or standardized measure for its diagnosis, the effect of this pathologic eating pattern on surgical weight loss outcomes will remain unclear. The bariatric community should be aware of the discrepancies in current research and exercise caution when interpreting research results surrounding this topic.

"Assessments of scoliosis are routinely done by means of clinical examination and full spinal x-rays. Multiple exposure to ionization radiation, however, can be hazardous to the child and is costly. Here, we explain the use of a noninvasive imaging technique, based on laser optical scanning, for quantifying the three-dimensional (3D) trunk surface topography that can be used to estimate parameters of 3D deformity of the spine. The laser optical scanning system consisted of four BIRIS laser cameras mounted on a ring moving along a vertical axis, producing a topographical mapping of the entire torso. In conjunction with the laser scans, an accurate 3D reconstruction of the spine and rib cage were developed from the digitized x-ray images. Results from 14 scoliotic patients are reported. The digitized surfaces provided the foundation data to start studying concordance of trunk surface asymmetry and spinal shape in idiopathic scoliosis.",non-technical,-,
"The study was carried out under a purpose; to carry out studio experimentation with selected unconventional media from environment to create designs and positively empower learners towards innovative studio practice. It was sought to inspire student teachers into appreciation and use unconventional materials which are cheap, unique in their studio practice under Art education to solve problem of insufficient materials for studio practice as a component of Art education.
The study was guided by three objectives which were derived from the study purpose; (a) to identify different unconventional materials that have been used in studio practice to create art works, (b) to establish attributes of Art education that can guide student teachers while exploring with unconventional materials in studio practice and (c) to experiment with selected unconventional materials to produce art works in Studio practice. I used mixed methods approaches that is to say participatory action research and experimentation to cater for the collaborative Studio practice.
Indigenous, modern and contemporary knowledge was considered in concept development. I worked with student teachers pursuing Bachelor of Vocational studies in Art and Design with Education (BVAD) year one in the Department of Art and Industrial Design Kyambogo University. Other interested parties that is to say lecturers, technicians and commercial artists also participated in this study as advisers and informants due to their experience.
Key attributes of Art education used in studio practice such as principles and elements of design in consideration of aesthetics and ergonomics where discussed and employed in the studio experimentation process. The findings proved unconventional materials as potential substitutes for conventional materials and an approach that can be considered to experiment with new unconventional media was suggested and proved positive.

"Community detection has become pervasive in finding similar patterns present in the network. It aims to discover lower dimensional embedding for representing the structure of network. Many real-life networks comprise overlapping communities and have non-linear features. Despite of having a great potential in analyzing the network structure, the existing approaches provide a limited support and find disjoint communities only. As data is growing unprecedentedly, scalable and intelligent solutions are obligatory for identifying similar patterns. Motivated by the robust representation ability of deep neural network based autoencoder, we proposed a learning model named ‘DeCom’ for finding overlapping communities from large networks. DeCom uses autoencoder based layered approach to initialize candidate seed nodes and to determine the number of communities by considering the network structure. The selected seed nodes and formed clusters are refined in last layer by minimizing the reconstruction error using modularity. The performance of DeCom is compared with three state-of-art clustering algorithms by using real life networks. It is observed that the felicitous selection of seed nodes reduces the number of iterations. The experimental results reveal that the proposed DeCom scales up linearly to handle large graphs and produces better quality of clusters when compared with the other state-of-art clustering algorithms.",non-technical,-,

"Nanocrystalline CdS thin films were prepared by chemical bath deposition technique using different capping agents – Mercaptoethanol (MEL), Thioglycerol (TG), Thiophenol (TP) and Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) for control of particle size. The effect of the different capping agents on the optical absorption spectra and transmittance spectra were studied. Shift in absorption edge to shorter wavelength is observed in all the nanocrystalline films in comparison to the bulk. However the PVP capped CdS films showed behavior similar to bulk. The values of Bandgap energy obtained from Tauc’s plot were found to be greater than that of the bulk film. Transmittance spectral studies show that Thioglycerol capped CdS films exhibited very high transmittance and correspondingly low absorbance as compared to the other nanocrstalline films making it suitable for application as antireflection coatings in Solar cells. The values of Refractive Index and Extinction Coefficient were calculated from Transmittance spectra. The highest value of Refractive Index ‘n’ is for Thiophenol capped CdS films at around 400nm. Refractive Index decreases with increase in wavelength in all the films. The variation of Extinction Coefficient ‘k’ with wavelength shows a rise and fall which is directly related to the absorption of light. In the case of bulk film, the values of k are high (1.1-1.7).In Mercaptoethanol and Thioglycerol capped films ‘k’ decreases at around 440nm while in Thiophenol capped films it decreases at 500 nm and in PVP capped films at 560 nm which can be attributed to the absorption edge in these films.

"The origins of aging of higher forms of life, particularly humans, is presented as the consequence of an evolved balance between 4 specific kinds of dysfunction-producing events and 4 kinds of evolved counteracting effects in long-lived forms. Among the deleterious events, particular importance is assigned to damage to DNA, but damage of a different kind than classical mutations. The evolution in man's ancestors of means to counteract the kinds of events that limit the life-spans of short lived mammals is postulated to be the indirect consequence of the prior evolution of superior mental capacities. Further, it is shown that the human species rapidly evolved its life-extending mutations because of the special circumstances afforded by the subdivision of the species into small semi-isolated (genetically) tribes of 10–100 individuals in which polygamy was the key factor in rapid incorporation of life- and well-being-extending new features. These conditions permit at least one or two orders of magnitude more of such beneficial genes to have been incorporated into our genomes during the 100,000 years or so of extremely rapid human evolution that evidently occurred about 100,000 to 200,000 years age than has been posited by other workers. The sources of damage to DNA are then considered, with special emphasis on free-radical derivatives of molecular oxygen and evidence is presented that longer lived forms of mammals have peroxide lysing enzymes that produce a lower steady state of damaging radicals derived from this compound. Evidence that so-called “classical” mutations cannot be the source of aging is then reviewed. A different kind of mutation, one that is not increased in proportion to point mutations by mutagens, namely deletio of tandemly duplicated copies of genes, is discussed and the evidence that such damage (gene loss) occurs in an amount sufficient to account for the major losses in function during aging is presented. The most likely mechanisms of such loss plus the prospects for evolving and bio-engineering means to counteract these losses together with some implications regarding the documented loss of of NORs with age (as regards rDNA loss) together with key areas for intensive present and future research on aging are presented.

"Mediation in general, and teacher and peer mediation in particular, whose genesis are Vygotsky's sociocultural and Feuerstein's mediated learning experience theories, is a novel approach aimed at teaching low level learners by an experienced instructor or peer. The main objectives of the present study, however, were to investigate the effects of teacher and peer mediation on EFL learners' grammar learning (active vs. passive voice) at pre-intermediate level. In addition, the focus was on the effectiveness of two strategies of mediation on the grammar learning and retention of target forms. To this end, a sample of 45 EFL learners at the age range of 14 to 19 was selected from among 68 low-intermediate learners of a private language institute in Khoy, Iran. A homogeneity test, pretest, immediate and delayed posttests were used as data collection tools. The results revealed that teacher mediation was more effective than the peer mediation and traditional group in improving the learning of active vs. passive voice in both the short-run and the long-run.

"Franklin Vernon provided an example of how programs viewing themselves as “cultural islands” are in fact embedded within historical capitalist relations, through the discourses of self that they promote. In this response, I expand on Vernon’s argument to situate the quasi-therapeutic practices he identified in the history of the human potential movement, which effectively merged with Outward Bound starting in the 1960s and continues to define outdoor experiential education. Where Vernon sought the structural referents to different models of self, this response seeks their historical origins. The response concludes by linking Vernon’s argument with existing critiques and parallel efforts in the literature on youth development and identity formation.",non-technical,-,

"Objective
Most of the doctors would regularly aspirate the plunger of a syringe before injection to make sure that the needle would not be mis-inserted into vessels. Yet pulling the plunger back only cannot guarantee the injecting status is safe. Injecting all of the non-fluid fillers, including colloidal hyaluronic acid (HA) into the vessel may cause “No blood return while pulling back the plunger,” which is defined as false-negative aspiration.
Methods
In the first experiment, HA syringes were inserted into vessel simulators in vitro with standard needle sizes and residual dosages. In the second experiment, the lidocaine-primed syringe were inserted into the vessel simulator instead to observe its aspiration.
Results
There was no difference using different sizes of needles or dosages except for group 0.1 mL and the lidocaine-primed syringe. The rest of the groups need to wait more seconds to observe the blood return.
Conclusions
The time lag does exist in every single aspiration and 88% of the blood return would happen in 10 s. We suggested that operators should aspirate regularly before giving an injection with at least 10 s of waiting or use the lidocaine-primed syringe instead. Blood returns could mostly be recognized in both ways.

"Constructed wetlands (CW) containing clinoptilolite zeolite and planted with five halophytes (Sesvium portulacastrum, Juncus effusus, Suaeda monoica, Inula crithmoides and Sarcocornia fruticosa) were irrigated with treated dairy farm effluent. The CW were operated for two years with retention time ranging from 2 to 7 d. Plant species did not affect SAR which was reduced in all treatments from 4.85 to 2.59 (mmol/L)0.5 due to ion exchange in zeolite. Halophytes increased evapotranspiration to 30 mm d−1 which countered sodium removal. Zeolite planted with Sesuvium portulacastrum had 15% lower sodium percentage (ESP, F1,118 = 12.53, p = 0.0006) and 5% higher calcium percentage (F1,118 = 7.44, p = 0.007) compared to non-planted zeolite, indicating reconditioning of zeolite with respect to sodium. Enhancement of SAR removal capability by reconditioned zeolite was demonstrated in 24 h batch experiments on excavated zeolite (n = 6) with saline water (SAR = 0, 17.6, 62.8, and 122.8 (mmol/L)0.5). Zeolite from Sesuvium planted CW reduced SAR to a greater extent than non-planted zeolite and was significant for inlet SAR 17.6 which was reduced to 3.33 ± 0.3 (mmol/L)0.5 compared to 3.68 ± 0.12 by non-planted zeolite (p < 0.05). In-situ biological reconditioning of active matrix in CW by tailored macrophytes is a novel strategy that may be applicable to other pollutants.",non-technical,-,

"Occurrence of Aspergillus flavus (A. flavus) in finished commercial broiler feed and among the isolated strains of A. flavus having capacity to produce aflatoxin was investigated in this study. Finished commercial broiler feed samples (n=96) were collected from broiler chicken farms in and around Quetta district. Physical properties i.e. moisture and pH were determined by oven drying and pH meter, respectively. Viable fungal count of the feed samples was estimated by using spread plate technique. Identification of fungal isolates was carried out on the basis of cultural and morphological characters by using slide culture technique. While mean moisture percentage was recorded as 5.3% with a significant difference (P<0.05), the pH was noted to be slightly acidic with non-significant difference (P>0.05) among seasons. Overall mean viable fungal count was 4.72 × 103±708 with a significant association (P<0.05) among seasons. Out comes from study showed that, 44.8% of the assayed samples were contaminated with A. flavus. From them, 48.8% of isolates were capable of producing aflatoxin B1.

"Currently, there is debate among scholars regarding how to operationalize and measure executive functions. These functions generally are referred to as “supervisory” cognitive processes because they involve higher level organization and execution of complex thoughts and behavior. Although conceptualizations vary regarding what mental processes actually constitute the “executive function” construct, there has been a historical linkage of these “higher-level” processes with the frontal lobes. In fact, many investigators have used the term “frontal functions” synonymously with “executive functions” despite evidence that contradicts this synonymous usage. The current review provides a critical analysis of lesion and neuroimaging studies using three popular executive function measures (Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, Phonemic Verbal Fluency, and Stroop Color Word Interference Test) in order to examine the validity of the executive function construct in terms of its relation to activation and damage to the frontal lobes. Empirical lesion data are examined via meta-analysis procedures along with formula derivatives. Results reveal mixed evidence that does not support a one-to-one relationship between executive functions and frontal lobe activity. The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications of construing the validity of these neuropsychological tests in anatomical, rather than cognitive and behavioral, terms.",non-technical,-,

"An aided phytostabilisation strategy consisting of several composite amendments of iron sulphate and organic materials combined with Lupinus albus L. (white lupin) was evaluated for remediation of an As- and Cu-contaminated soil. Iron sulphate was combined with lime, paper mill sludge (PS), olive mill waste compost (OMWC) or holm oak biochar (BC) and applied to a slightly acidic soil with high concentration of As (∼2200 mg kg−1) and Cu (∼150 mg kg−1). White lupin was grown for 48 days in pots containing amended and non-amended soils and the effect of soil treatments on soluble and extractable trace elements, soil fertility and plant growth and composition was evaluated. The addition of the amendments raised soil pH and reduced soluble As (50–93%) and extractable As and Cu (50–89%). Despite the reduction of As- and Cu-extractable fractions, plant As and Cu uptake was not greatly affected by the amendments. Variations in soil pH and P-Olsen seemed to have influenced As dynamics in the treated soils, although they did not provoke its mobilisation with respect to the non-amended soil. Our results suggest that the freshly formed iron oxides resulting from addition of iron sulphate controlled As dynamics in the treated soils, avoiding its mobilisation due to application of organic materials. The combination of iron sulphate with OMWC and BC is shown as appropriate for aided phytostabilisation of metal(loid)s contaminated soils, as it improved soil fertility and plant nutrition while reduced As and Cu mobility.

"This report addresses the relationship between education and creativity in Japan, with a focus on four issues. First, the definition and measurement of creativity is discussed. Approaches to the measurement of creativity are presented and criticized, and different meanings of creativity (i.e., originality, deviation from the group, self-expression, and achievement) are discussed. Second, evidence is reviewed from Western psychological and educational research on the factors which promote or inhibit the development of creativity. Third, Japanese education is discussed in light of the Western research findings on the factors which promote or inhibit creativity. Finally, creativity is discussed as a larger societal issue in Japan, with a view to the societal indicators which might be used to measure creativity. A number of factors are identified which may encourage the development of creativity in Japanese children, including: relatively non-controlling early child rearing, high development of basic skills which provide the basis for creative accomplishments, an emphasis on persistence and repeated practice for mastery, and educational practices which foster intrinsic motivation. Other factors are identified which may inhibit the development of creativity in Japanese children, including the rote memorization required for examination preparation, the possible impact of the examinations in undermining intrinsic motivation, and the possible low tolerance for deviation from conventional thought.",non-technical,-,

The purpose of this paper is to summarize the application of several external treatments in this disease, and to provide a variety of references for clinical treatment of CRF.",non-technical,-,
"The suppressive tumour microenvironment significantly hinders the efficacy of immunotherapy in treating solid tumors. In this context, stromal cells, such as tumour-associated fibroblasts, undergo changes that include an increase in the number and function of immunosuppressive cells. Adenosine, a factor that promotes tumour growth, is produced from ATP breakdown and is markedly elevated in the tumour microenvironment. It acts through specific binding to adenosine receptors, with A2A and A2B adenosine receptor being primary drivers of immunosuppression. This paper presents the roles of various adenosine receptors in different tumour microenvironments. This review focus on the function of adenosine receptors in the stromal cells and non-cellular components of the tumour microenvironment. Additionally, we summarize and discuss recent advances and potential trends in using adenosine receptor antagonists combined with immunotherapy.",non-technical,-,
"This paper presents an overview of Wire Arc Additive manufacturing technologies for production of metal parts. It is mostly preferable to complex design. Requires minimum time for manufacturing. Aluminium alloy AL1060 selected for fabricating the part, because the Aluminium has good conductor of heat and thermal conductivity, also it is much denser than other material. Wire and arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) has proven that it can produce medium to large components because of its high-rate deposition and potentially unlimited build size. Like all additive manufacturing (AM) technologies, however, an optimized process planning that provides uniform, defect-free deposition is key for the production of parts. Moreover, AM, particularly WAAM, is no longer just a prototyping technology, and most of today's attention is on its transformation to a viable and cost-effective production. With this transformation, a number of issues need to be addressed, including the accuracy and effectiveness of the manufactured components. Therefore, the emphasis should be on dimensional precision and surface finish in WAAM. This paper covers heat input and management concept, related to the resulting shrinkage, deformation, and residual stresses, which is particularly critical. In addition, we focus on process planning including build orientation, slicing, and path planning, as well as the definition of process parameter selection from a single track to multi-track and multilayer, and finally geometric features froma thin-wall to lattice structures with several case studies",non-technical,-,
"Research of the marine environment is still a huge challenge for humanity. Each survey campaign is a complex project, where research vessels and relevant survey equipment is used. One of the problems that limit the success of working at sea are failures of survey equipment. The aim of this paper was to identify the most common survey equipment failures during marine research, find their causes and analyze identified risks. The authors employ risk assessment methodology in maritime research at sea and present its practical utility and contribution in social and organizational development. For this purpose we based the analysis on the review of relevant project documentation (Daily Progress Reports, Observation Cards) and the questionnaire addressed to specialists who carry out their survey work on board research vessels and also people involved in the implementation of offshore projects. The research reveals that 76.3% respondents participated in a project which had to be stopped due to a failure of the survey equipment that required return to the port which highlights that the problem which was analyzed is of particular importance. The questionnaire form was designed to obtain as much information as possible on the types of failures with examples and also their causes according to three groups: human factors, technical factors and forces of nature. Twelve risks were identified and analyzed. The authors also stress the relationship between the quality of research project management and its implementation in the context of the failure rate of measuring equipment.

"We studied the PEMF power attenuation in tissues representative of clinical applications (blood and cortical bone) to determine the amount of power available for PEMF purported biological effects. The experimental system consisted of a pair of nearly circular, parallel and coaxial coils separated by a distance of one coil diameter. The power attenuation was measured using a small search coil connected to a digital oscilloscope. The coils were powered by a voltage switch operating at two different frequencies (3.8 and 63 kHz) producing bursts of pulses (numbering 21 and 1619) and triggered at two different frequencies (1.5 and 15 Hz, respectively). The tissue samples were placed inside the coils so as to expose them to either transverse electric field (at the center of coils) or the transverse magnetic field (at the coil wire). The cylindrical coil geometry yielded closed-form expressions for power attenuation based on magnetic diffusion equation and ohmic losses due to bulk tissue magnetic permeability and electrical conductivity. The measured power attenuation at these PEMF frequencies of not more than one decibel (1 dB) was well explained by the theory for the 3.8 kHz but less so for the 63 kHz frequency PEMF. The results provide important insights regarding physical mechanism of weak PEMF power dissipation in tissues.

"BACKGROUND:  Hypoxemia and pulmonary complications are common after upper abdominal surgery (UAS).
OBJECTIVE:  To examine whether inclusion of autogenic drainage (AD) in chest physiotherapy after UAS confers additional benefits in improving blood gases and reducing postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs).
DESIGN AND SETTING:  Randomized controlled study conducted at Kasr Al-Ainy teaching hospital, Egypt.
METHODS:  A randomized controlled trial was conducted on 48 subjects undergoing elective UAS with high risk of developing PPCs. The study group received AD plus routine chest physiotherapy (deep diaphragmatic breathing, localized breathing and splinted coughing) and the control group received routine chest physiotherapy only. The outcomes included arterial blood gases measured at the first and seventh postoperative days, incidence of PPCs within the first seven days and length of hospital stay.
RESULTS:  Baseline characteristics were similar between groups. In the AD group, SaO2, PaO2, PaCO2 and HCO3 significantly improved (P < 0.05) while in the physiotherapy group, only SaO2 and PaO2 significantly improved (P < 0.05). Nonetheless, significant differences in post-treatment SaO2 and PaO2 between the groups were observed. The overall incidence of PPCs was 16.66% (12.5% in the AD group and 20.8% in the physiotherapy group) (absolute risk reduction -8.3%; 95% confidence interval, CI, -13.5 to 29.6%), with no significant difference between the groups. The AD group had a significantly shorter hospital stay (P = 0.0001).
CONCLUSION:  Adding AD to routine chest physiotherapy after UAS provided a favorable blood gas outcome and reduced the length of hospital stay. It tended to reduce the incidence of PPCs.",non-technical,-,
"Clustering by fast search and find of density peaks (CFSFDP) is proposed to cluster the data by finding of density peaks. CFSFDP is based on two assumptions that: a cluster center is a high dense data point as compared to its surrounding neighbors, and it lies at a large distance from other cluster centers. Based on these assumptions, CFSFDP supports a heuristic approach, known as decision graph to manually select cluster centers. Manual selection of cluster centers is a big limitation of CFSFDP in intelligent data analysis. In this paper, we proposed a fuzzy-CFSFDP method for adaptively selecting the cluster centers, effectively. It uses the fuzzy rules, based on aforementioned assumption for the selection of cluster centers. We performed a number of experiments on nine synthetic clustering datasets and compared the resulting clusters with the state-of-the-art methods. Clustering results and the comparisons of synthetic data validate the robustness and effectiveness of proposed fuzzy-CFSFDP method",non-technical,-,
"This research utilizes the survey questionnaire data collected in May/June 2010 from 200 Amway Company’s direct sales forces in Klang Valley areas (Malaysia) to analyze the effectiveness of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation in influencing job satisfaction. The research will be analyzed using the well-established correlation analysis, regression analysis, independent sample t-test, and one-way ANOVA. There are four major findings. First, there is a relationship between intrinsic and extrinsic motivations with job satisfaction. According to the correlation value, intrinsic motivation compared to extrinsic motivation tends to contribute more in job satisfaction. Second, there are significant and positive relationship between intrinsic and extrinsic motivations and job satisfaction. Both of the intrinsic and extrinsic motivation is identified as the predictor for job satisfaction. In other words, they are both significantly contribute in better job satisfaction. Third, there is no difference between gender and intrinsic and extrinsic motivations. Hence, gender is not a factor that affects both of the intrinsic and extrinsic motivations. Lastly, the result indicates that there is a difference between age and intrinsic and extrinsic motivations. Therefore, age is the factor that influences on both intrinsic and extrinsic motivations. Last but not least, the results have demonstrated the effectiveness of intrinsic and extrinsic motivations in influencing job satisfaction among the Amway Company’s direct sales forces, as well as establishing appropriate intrinsic motivations may promote higher job satisfaction.",non-technical,-,

"This study aims to explore the use and relevance of Narrative approaches to psycho- social interventions in the South African context. The profession of psychology in South Africa has been in a state of discontentment since the country’s turn to democracy in 1994 which has been voiced from both those within the profession and those it aims to assist. The loudest call is for a psychology that is relevant to the South African context – culturally, socially, and politically.
Narrative approaches to psychotherapy and psycho-social intervention are grounded in post-modern and social-constructionist thought and offer an alternative to mainstream psychological theory. Narrative practice aims to promote social justice and views therapy as a political act. It is also an approach that values local knowledges and sees all therapeutic engagements as cross-cultural encounters which are approached with curiosity and a not-knowing stance, rather than an interpretive, analytical lens.
This study has investigated what the existing literature has produced regarding the use and relevance of Narrative approaches in South Africa context. The research process was implemented using a mixed methods research methodology whereby a sample of 58 journal articles (n=58) were analysed using both quantitative and qualitative content analysis. The common themes that emerged from the articles were ‘viewing people in context’, ‘listening to the telling of stories’, ‘theoretical constructs of a narrative approach’, and ‘social phenomena’.

"Israeli non-governmental organizations (NGOs) resisting the security fence and other Israeli security measures are in `virtual isolation' in networks dedicated to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, and especially to the criticism of Israeli governmental policies and the construction of the security fence. The research reported is a hyperlink and term analysis of select issue networks on the web assembled around the security fence and other conflict issues. It shows that attempts by left-leaning Israeli NGO network actors to frame the issue in their own critical terms are ignored by networked transnational actors working in the Palestinian-Israeli issue space, even though it may be that both kinds of organizations campaign against it. The Israeli organizations, it was found, are largely in an issue space of their own making, distinct from the human rights frame that dominates the transnational networks. In putting forward the notion of the separation fence, theirs is also a particular local `peace process' approach to issue settlement, different not only from that of the dominant trans-national issue networks on the web, but also from official Israeli as well as certain Western governmental positions. The article concludes by finding that, according to the web, the local peace process is not a trans-national issue network affair.",non-technical,-,
"Data engineering is the practice of designing and building systems for the aggregation, storage and analysis of data at scale. Data engineers empower organizations to get insights in real time from large datasets.

From social media and marketing metrics to employee performance statistics and trend forecasts, enterprises have all the data they need to compile a holistic view of their operations. Data engineers transform massive quantities of data into valuable strategic findings.

With proper data engineering, stakeholders across an organization—executives, developers, data scientists and business intelligence (BI) analysts—can access the datasets they need at any time in a manner that is reliable, convenient and secure.

Organizations have access to more data—and more data types—than ever before. Every bit of data can potentially inform a crucial business decision. Data engineers govern data management for downstream use including analysis, forecasting or machine learning.

As specialized computer scientists, data engineers excel at creating and deploying algorithms, data pipelines and workflows that sort raw data into ready-to-use datasets. Data engineering is an integral component of the modern data platform and makes it possible for businesses to analyze and apply the data they receive, regardless of the data source or format.

Even under a decentralized data mesh management system, a core team of data engineers is still responsible for overall infrastructure health.",technical,,Software and System development
"Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses multilayered neural networks, called deep neural networks, that more closely simulate the complex decision-making power of the human brain.

Deep neural networks include an input layer, at least three but usually hundreds of hidden layers, and an output layer, unlike neural networks used in classic machine learning models, which usually have only one or two hidden layers.

These multiple layers enable unsupervised learning: they can automate the extraction of features from large, unlabeled and unstructured data sets, and make their own predictions about what the data represents.

Because deep learning doesn’t require human intervention, it enables machine learning at a tremendous scale. It is well suited to natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, and other tasks that involve the fast, accurate identification complex patterns and relationships in large amounts of data. Some form of deep learning powers most of the artificial intelligence (AI) applications in our lives today.

"Generative AI, sometimes called ""gen AI"", refers to deep learning models that can create complex original content—such as long-form text, high-quality images, realistic video or audio and more—in response to a user’s prompt or request.

At a high level, generative models encode a simplified representation of their training data, and then draw from that representation to create new work that’s similar, but not identical, to the original data.

Generative models have been used for years in statistics to analyze numerical data. But over the last decade, they evolved to analyze and generate more complex data types. This evolution coincided with the emergence of three sophisticated deep learning model types:

Variational autoencoders or VAEs, which were introduced in 2013, and enabled models that could generate multiple variations of content in response to a prompt or instruction.

Diffusion models, first seen in 2014, which add ""noise"" to images until they are unrecognizable, and then remove the noise to generate original images in response to prompts.

Transformers (also called transformer models), which are trained on sequenced data to generate extended sequences of content (such as words in sentences, shapes in an image, frames of a video or commands in software code). Transformers are at the core of most of today’s headline-making generative AI tools, including ChatGPT and GPT-4, Copilot, BERT, Bard and Midjourney.",technical,,Software and System development
"How generative AI—like ChatGPT—is already transforming businesses
The global generative AI market is approaching an inflection point, with a valuation of USD 8 billion and an estimated CAGR of 34.6% by 2030. With more than 85 million jobs expected to go unfilled by that time, creating more intelligent operations with AI and automation is required to deliver the efficiency, effectiveness and experiences that business leaders and stakeholders expect.

Generative AI presents a compelling opportunity to augment employee efforts and make the enterprise more productive. But as C-Suite leaders research generative AI solutions, they are uncovering more questions: Which use cases will deliver the most value for my business? Which AI technology is best suited for my needs? Is it secure? Is it sustainable? How is it governed? And how do I ensure my AI projects succeed?

How do AI, machine learning, deep learning and neural networks relate to each other?
The easiest way to think about AI, machine learning, deep learning and neural networks is to think of them as a series of AI systems from largest to smallest, each encompassing the next.

AI is the overarching system. Machine learning is a subset of AI. Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning, and neural networks make up the backbone of deep learning algorithms. It’s the number of node layers, or depth, of neural networks that distinguishes a single neural network from a deep learning algorithm, which must have more than three.

What is AI?
Artificial intelligence or AI, the broadest term of the three, is used to classify machines that mimic human intelligence and human cognitive functions like problem-solving and learning. AI uses predictions and automation to optimize and solve complex tasks that humans have historically done, such as facial and speech recognition, decision-making and translation.

 

Categories of AI

The three main categories of AI are:

Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI)
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)
Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI)
ANI is considered “weak” AI, whereas the other two types are classified as “strong” AI. We define weak AI by its ability to complete a specific task, like winning a chess game or identifying a particular individual in a series of photos. Natural language processing and computer vision, which let companies automate tasks and underpin chatbots and virtual assistants such as Siri and Alexa, are examples of ANI. Computer vision is a factor in the development of self-driving cars.

Stronger forms of AI, like AGI and ASI, incorporate human behaviors more prominently, such as the ability to interpret tone and emotion. Strong AI is defined by its ability compared to humans. AGI would perform on par with another human, while ASI—also known as superintelligence—would surpass a human’s intelligence and ability. Neither form of Strong AI exists yet, but research in this field is ongoing.",technical,,Software and System development
"What is machine learning?
Machine learning is a subset of AI that allows for optimization. When set up correctly, it helps you make predictions that minimize the errors that arise from merely guessing. For example, companies like Amazon use machine learning to recommend products to a specific customer based on what they’ve looked at and bought before.

Classic or “nondeep” machine learning depends on human intervention to allow a computer system to identify patterns, learn, perform specific tasks and provide accurate results. Human experts determine the hierarchy of features to understand the differences between data inputs, usually requiring more structured data to learn.

For example, let’s say I showed you a series of images of different types of fast food: “pizza,” “burger” and “taco.” A human expert working on those images would determine the characteristics distinguishing each picture as a specific fast food type. The bread in each food type might be a distinguishing feature. Alternatively, they might use labels, such as “pizza,” “burger” or “taco” to streamline the learning process through supervised learning.

While the subset of AI called deep machine learning can leverage labeled data sets to inform its algorithm in supervised learning, it doesn’t necessarily require a labeled data set. It can ingest unstructured data in its raw form (for example, text, images), and it can automatically determine the set of features that distinguish “pizza,” “burger” and “taco” from one another. As we generate more big data, data scientists use more machine learning. For a deeper dive into the differences between these approaches, check out Supervised versus unsupervised learning: What’s the difference?

A third category of machine learning is reinforcement learning, where a computer learns by interacting with its surroundings and getting feedback (rewards or penalties) for its actions. And online learning is a type of ML where a data scientist updates the ML model as new data becomes available.",technical,,Software and System development
"How deep learning differs from machine learning
As our article on deep learning explains, deep learning is a subset of machine learning. The primary difference between machine learning and deep learning is how each algorithm learns and how much data each type of algorithm uses.

Deep learning automates much of the feature extraction piece of the process, eliminating some of the manual human intervention required. It also enables the use of large data sets, earning the title of scalable machine learning. That capability is exciting as we explore the use of unstructured data further, particularly since over 80% of an organization’s data is estimated to be unstructured.

Observing patterns in the data allows a deep-learning model to cluster inputs appropriately. Taking the same example from earlier, we might group pictures of pizzas, burgers and tacos into their respective categories based on the similarities or differences identified in the images. A deep-learning model requires more data points to improve accuracy, whereas a machine-learning model relies on less data given its underlying data structure. Enterprises generally use deep learning for more complex tasks, like virtual assistants or fraud detection.

What is a neural network?
Neural networks, also called artificial neural networks or simulated neural networks, are a subset of machine learning and are the backbone of deep learning algorithms. They are called “neural” because they mimic how neurons in the brain signal one another.

Neural networks are made up of node layers—an input layer, one or more hidden layers and an output layer. Each node is an artificial neuron that connects to the next, and each has a weight and threshold value. When one node’s output is above the threshold value, that node is activated and sends its data to the network’s next layer. If it’s below the threshold, no data passes along.

Training data teach neural networks and help improve their accuracy over time. Once the learning algorithms are fined-tuned, they become powerful computer science and AI tools because they allow us to quickly classify and cluster data. Using neural networks, speech and image recognition tasks can happen in minutes instead of the hours they take when done manually. Google’s search algorithm is a well-known example of a neural network.",technical,,Software and System development
"Why is AI important?
AI is important for its potential to change how we live, work and play. It has been effectively used in business to automate tasks traditionally done by humans, including customer service, lead generation, fraud detection and quality control.

In a number of areas, AI can perform tasks more efficiently and accurately than humans. It is especially useful for repetitive, detail-oriented tasks such as analyzing large numbers of legal documents to ensure relevant fields are properly filled in. AI's ability to process massive data sets gives enterprises insights into their operations they might not otherwise have noticed. The rapidly expanding array of generative AI tools is also becoming important in fields ranging from education to marketing to product design.

Advances in AI techniques have not only helped fuel an explosion in efficiency, but also opened the door to entirely new business opportunities for some larger enterprises. Prior to the current wave of AI, for example, it would have been hard to imagine using computer software to connect riders to taxis on demand, yet Uber has become a Fortune 500 company by doing just that.

AI has become central to many of today's largest and most successful companies, including Alphabet, Apple, Microsoft and Meta, which use AI to improve their operations and outpace competitors. At Alphabet subsidiary Google, for example, AI is central to its eponymous search engine, and self-driving car company Waymo began as an Alphabet division. The Google Brain research lab also invented the transformer architecture that underpins recent NLP breakthroughs such as OpenAI's ChatGPT.

"Advantages of AI
The following are some advantages of AI:

Excellence in detail-oriented jobs. AI is a good fit for tasks that involve identifying subtle patterns and relationships in data that might be overlooked by humans. For example, in oncology, AI systems have demonstrated high accuracy in detecting early-stage cancers, such as breast cancer and melanoma, by highlighting areas of concern for further evaluation by healthcare professionals.
Efficiency in data-heavy tasks. AI systems and automation tools dramatically reduce the time required for data processing. This is particularly useful in sectors like finance, insurance and healthcare that involve a great deal of routine data entry and analysis, as well as data-driven decision-making. For example, in banking and finance, predictive AI models can process vast volumes of data to forecast market trends and analyze investment risk.
Time savings and productivity gains. AI and robotics can not only automate operations but also improve safety and efficiency. In manufacturing, for example, AI-powered robots are increasingly used to perform hazardous or repetitive tasks as part of warehouse automation, thus reducing the risk to human workers and increasing overall productivity.
Consistency in results. Today's analytics tools use AI and machine learning to process extensive amounts of data in a uniform way, while retaining the ability to adapt to new information through continuous learning. For example, AI applications have delivered consistent and reliable outcomes in legal document review and language translation.
Customization and personalization. AI systems can enhance user experience by personalizing interactions and content delivery on digital platforms. On e-commerce platforms, for example, AI models analyze user behavior to recommend products suited to an individual's preferences, increasing customer satisfaction and engagement.
Round-the-clock availability. AI programs do not need to sleep or take breaks. For example, AI-powered virtual assistants can provide uninterrupted, 24/7 customer service even under high interaction volumes, improving response times and reducing costs.
Scalability. AI systems can scale to handle growing amounts of work and data. This makes AI well suited for scenarios where data volumes and workloads can grow exponentially, such as internet search and business analytics.
Accelerated research and development. AI can speed up the pace of R&D in fields such as pharmaceuticals and materials science. By rapidly simulating and analyzing many possible scenarios, AI models can help researchers discover new drugs, materials or compounds more quickly than traditional methods.
Sustainability and conservation. AI and machine learning are increasingly used to monitor environmental changes, predict future weather events and manage conservation efforts. Machine learning models can process satellite imagery and sensor data to track wildfire risk, pollution levels and endangered species populations, for example.
Process optimization. AI is used to streamline and automate complex processes across various industries. For example, AI models can identify inefficiencies and predict bottlenecks in manufacturing workflows, while in the energy sector, they can forecast electricity demand and allocate supply in real time.",technical,,Software and System development
"Disadvantages of AI
The following are some disadvantages of AI:

High costs. Developing AI can be very expensive. Building an AI model requires a substantial upfront investment in infrastructure, computational resources and software to train the model and store its training data. After initial training, there are further ongoing costs associated with model inference and retraining. As a result, costs can rack up quickly, particularly for advanced, complex systems like generative AI applications; OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has stated that training the company's GPT-4 model cost over $100 million.
Technical complexity. Developing, operating and troubleshooting AI systems -- especially in real-world production environments -- requires a great deal of technical know-how. In many cases, this knowledge differs from that needed to build non-AI software. For example, building and deploying a machine learning application involves a complex, multistage and highly technical process, from data preparation to algorithm selection to parameter tuning and model testing.
Talent gap. Compounding the problem of technical complexity, there is a significant shortage of professionals trained in AI and machine learning compared with the growing need for such skills. This gap between AI talent supply and demand means that, even though interest in AI applications is growing, many organizations cannot find enough qualified workers to staff their AI initiatives.
Algorithmic bias. AI and machine learning algorithms reflect the biases present in their training data -- and when AI systems are deployed at scale, the biases scale, too. In some cases, AI systems may even amplify subtle biases in their training data by encoding them into reinforceable and pseudo-objective patterns. In one well-known example, Amazon developed an AI-driven recruitment tool to automate the hiring process that inadvertently favored male candidates, reflecting larger-scale gender imbalances in the tech industry.
Difficulty with generalization. AI models often excel at the specific tasks for which they were trained but struggle when asked to address novel scenarios. This lack of flexibility can limit AI's usefulness, as new tasks might require the development of an entirely new model. An NLP model trained on English-language text, for example, might perform poorly on text in other languages without extensive additional training. While work is underway to improve models' generalization ability -- known as domain adaptation or transfer learning -- this remains an open research problem.
Job displacement. AI can lead to job loss if organizations replace human workers with machines -- a growing area of concern as the capabilities of AI models become more sophisticated and companies increasingly look to automate workflows using AI. For example, some copywriters have reported being replaced by large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT. While widespread AI adoption may also create new job categories, these may not overlap with the jobs eliminated, raising concerns about economic inequality and reskilling.
Security vulnerabilities. AI systems are susceptible to a wide range of cyberthreats, including data poisoning and adversarial machine learning. Hackers can extract sensitive training data from an AI model, for example, or trick AI systems into producing incorrect and harmful output. This is particularly concerning in security-sensitive sectors such as financial services and government.
Environmental impact. The data centers and network infrastructures that underpin the operations of AI models consume large amounts of energy and water. Consequently, training and running AI models has a significant impact on the climate. AI's carbon footprint is especially concerning for large generative models, which require a great deal of computing resources for training and ongoing use.
Legal issues. AI raises complex questions around privacy and legal liability, particularly amid an evolving AI regulation landscape that differs across regions. Using AI to analyze and make decisions based on personal data has serious privacy implications, for example, and it remains unclear how courts will view the authorship of material generated by LLMs trained on copyrighted works.",technical,,Software and System development
"Data Analysis Process
The data analysis is a structured sequence of steps that lead from raw data to actionable insights. Here are the answers to what is data analysis:

Data Collection: Gather relevant data from various sources, ensuring data quality and integrity.
Data Cleaning: Identify and rectify errors, missing values, and inconsistencies in the dataset. Clean data is crucial for accurate analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct preliminary analysis to understand the data's characteristics, distributions, and relationships. Visualization techniques are often used here.
Data Transformation: Prepare the data for analysis by encoding categorical variables, scaling features, and handling outliers, if necessary.
Model Building: Depending on the objectives, apply appropriate data analysis methods, such as regression, clustering, or deep learning.
Model Evaluation: Depending on the problem type, assess the models' performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error, Root Mean Squared Error, etc.
Interpretation and Visualization: Translate the model's results into actionable insights. Visualizations, tables, and summary statistics help in conveying findings effectively.
Deployment: Implement the insights into real-world solutions or strategies, ensuring that the data-driven recommendations are implemented.",technical,,Software and System development

The trend of remote work affects data science too. Many data scientists now work from home or remote locations. This opens up a wider talent pool. Companies can hire remote data scientists from anywhere in the world. This flexibility is a big advantage in today’s global market.",technical,,Software and System development
"Automation of Data Science Tasks
By 2030, advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) are expected to automate several routine data science tasks like data cleaning, feature engineering, and model selection. This automation can reduce the demand for traditional data scientists who currently perform these tasks manually. Tools like Google’s AutoML and Microsoft’s Azure ML are enabling business users with little to no data science background to perform complex analyses. As these tools become more sophisticated, the need for specialized data science professionals might diminish.

Integration into Business Functions
Business may integrate data science capabilities directly into business functions rather than relying on centralized data science teams. This shift could lead to fewer standalone data science roles and more hybrid roles where employees in marketing, finance, or operations possess data science skills. As data literacy improves across organizations, non-specialists in various departments are likely to take on data analysis tasks, further reducing the need for dedicated data scientists.

Increased Competition and Market Saturation
As more data science professionals enter the field and more universities offer data science programs, the job market could become oversaturated, leading to fewer job openings and potentially lower salaries. With the rise of remote work and global collaboration tools, organizations may increasingly outsource data science tasks to countries with lower labor costs, reducing demand in traditional high-cost markets.",technical,,Software and System development
"Many professionals view machine learning as advanced technology that you deploy when other approaches fail. In their mind, it’s a sophisticated tool reserved for problems too complex for conventional methods.

Therefore, when I talk to businesses, I often hear comments like “We don’t need to use machine learning for that” or “We solved that problem years ago before machine learning was a thing”.

Sometimes, those comments are valid, making machine learning the wrong technology. However, more often, they stem from a false belief that their traditional approach is the straightforward alternative, and that misconception leads to businesses sticking with and maintaining outdated solutions.

The reality is that machine learning is a fantastic tool for creating robust and easy-to-maintain solutions to simple problems. You can often replace thousands of lines of code with a single line, performing the task more accurately and reliably. I’ve worked with several companies who were astonished at how much easier their solution became when we replaced their manual rule with a machine learning algorithm.

Let’s explore this topic together and learn a few valuable lessons you can apply to your work using real examples.

Example of a simple task
My company develops deep learning algorithms that detect damage and essential components in visual data. Currently, we focus primarily on the railway industry, and therefore, many of my examples are centered around computer vision with data from the railroad industry.

However, these examples directly apply to other datasets, industries, and use cases. For a machine learning engineer, there’s little difference when you switch to another use case or industry as long as the data type remains similar and you have access to someone with domain expertise.

Detecting rail heads in track imagery
I want to explain this lesson by showing you an example where I use machine learning instead of traditional computer vision to create a reliable solution in one hour of work. Let’s start by looking at these three 2D images of a railway sleeper taken from a measurement train on different dates.",technical,,Software and System development
"Predicting Time Series Data with Machine Learning, Generative AI, and Deep Learning Time series data prediction is a critical aspect of various industries, ranging from finance and healthcare to marketing and logistics. The ability to forecast future values based on historical data can drive significant improvements in decision-making processes and operational efficiency. With advancements in machine learning, generative AI, and deep learning, there are now more sophisticated methods available for tackling time series prediction problems. This blog will explore different approaches and models that can be used for time series data prediction.

Understanding Time Series Data
Time series data is a sequence of data points collected or recorded at specific time intervals. Examples include stock prices, weather data, sales figures, and sensor readings. The goal of time series prediction is to use past observations to predict future values, which can be challenging due to the inherent complexities and patterns within the data.

"What is data science used for?
Data science is used to study data in four main ways:

1. Descriptive analysis
Descriptive analysis examines data to gain insights into what happened or what is happening in the data environment. It is characterized by data visualizations such as pie charts, bar charts, line graphs, tables, or generated narratives. For example, a flight booking service may record data like the number of tickets booked each day. Descriptive analysis will reveal booking spikes, booking slumps, and high-performing months for this service.

2. Diagnostic analysis
Diagnostic analysis is a deep-dive or detailed data examination to understand why something happened. It is characterized by techniques such as drill-down, data discovery, data mining, and correlations. Multiple data operations and transformations may be performed on a given data set to discover unique patterns in each of these techniques.For example, the flight service might drill down on a particularly high-performing month to better understand the booking spike. This may lead to the discovery that many customers visit a particular city to attend a monthly sporting event.

3. Predictive analysis
Predictive analysis uses historical data to make accurate forecasts about data patterns that may occur in the future. It is characterized by techniques such as machine learning, forecasting, pattern matching, and predictive modeling. In each of these techniques, computers are trained to reverse engineer causality connections in the data.For example, the flight service team might use data science to predict flight booking patterns for the coming year at the start of each year. The computer program or algorithm may look at past data and predict booking spikes for certain destinations in May. Having anticipated their customer’s future travel requirements, the company could start targeted advertising for those cities from February.

4. Prescriptive analysis
Prescriptive analytics takes predictive data to the next level. It not only predicts what is likely to happen but also suggests an optimum response to that outcome. It can analyze the potential implications of different choices and recommend the best course of action. It uses graph analysis, simulation, complex event processing, neural networks, and recommendation engines from machine learning.         

Back to the flight booking example, prescriptive analysis could look at historical marketing campaigns to maximize the advantage of the upcoming booking spike. A data scientist could project booking outcomes for different levels of marketing spend on various marketing channels. These data forecasts would give the flight booking company greater confidence in their marketing decisions.",technical,,Software and System development
"What are the benefits of data science for business?
Data science is revolutionizing the way companies operate. Many businesses, regardless of size, need a robust data science strategy to drive growth and maintain a competitive edge. Some key benefits include:

Discover unknown transformative patterns
Data science allows businesses to uncover new patterns and relationships that have the potential to transform the organization. It can reveal low-cost changes to resource management for maximum impact on profit margins.For example, an e-commerce company uses data science to discover that too many customer queries are being generated after business hours. Investigations reveal that customers are more likely to purchase if they receive a prompt response instead of an answer the next business day. By implementing 24/7 customer service, the business grows its revenue by 30%.

Innovate new products and solutions
Data science can reveal gaps and problems that would otherwise go unnoticed. Greater insight about purchase decisions, customer feedback, and business processes can drive innovation in internal operations and external solutions.For example, an online payment solution uses data science to collate and analyze customer comments about the company on social media. Analysis reveals that customers forget passwords during peak purchase periods and are unhappy with the current password retrieval system. The company can innovate a better solution and see a significant increase in customer satisfaction.",technical,,Software and System development
"What are the data science techniques?
Data science professionals use computing systems to follow the data science process. The top techniques used by data scientists are:

Classification
Classification is the sorting of data into specific groups or categories. Computers are trained to identify and sort data. Known data sets are used to build decision algorithms in a computer that quickly processes and categorizes the data. For example:·  

Sort products as popular or not popular·  
Sort insurance applications as high risk or low risk·  
Sort social media comments into positive, negative, or neutral.
Data science professionals use computing systems to follow the data science process. 

Regression
Regression is the method of finding a relationship between two seemingly unrelated data points. The connection is usually modeled around a mathematical formula and represented as a graph or curves. When the value of one data point is known, regression is used to predict the other data point. For example:·  

The rate of spread of air-borne diseases.· 
 The relationship between customer satisfaction and the number of employees.·  
The relationship between the number of fire stations and the number of injuries due to fire in a particular location. 
Clustering
Clustering is the method of grouping closely related data together to look for patterns and anomalies. Clustering is different from sorting because the data cannot be accurately classified into fixed categories. Hence the data is grouped into most likely relationships. New patterns and relationships can be discovered with clustering. For example: ·  

Group customers with similar purchase behavior for improved customer service.·  
Group network traffic to identify daily usage patterns and identify a network attack faster.  
Cluster articles into multiple different news categories and use this information to find fake news content.
The basic principle behind data science techniques
While the details vary, the underlying principles behind these techniques are:

Teach a machine how to sort data based on a known data set. For example, sample keywords are given to the computer with their sort value. “Happy” is positive, while “Hate” is negative.
Give unknown data to the machine and allow the device to sort the dataset independently.
 Allow for result inaccuracies and handle the probability factor of the result.",technical,,Software and System development
"Real Life Example of Data Science
There are lot of examples you can observe around yourself, where data science is being used. For Example – Social Media, Medical, Preparing strategy for Cricket or FIFA by analyzing past matches. Here are some more real life examples:

Social Media Recommendation:
Have you ever wondered why you always get Instagram Reels aligned towards your interest? These platforms uses data-science to Analyze your past interest/data (Like, Comments, watch etc) and create personalized recommendation to serve content that matches your interests.",technical,,Software and System development
"eep learning algorithms
Deep learning algorithms are typically trained on large datasets of labeled data. The algorithms learn to associate features in the data with the correct labels. For example, in an image recognition task, the algorithm might learn to associate certain features in an image (such as the shape of an object or the color of an object) with the correct label (such as ""dog"" or ""cat"").

Once a deep learning algorithm has been trained, it can be used to make predictions on new data. For example, a deep learning algorithm that has been trained to recognize images of dogs can be used to identify dogs in new images.",technical,,Software and System development
"Types of deep learning
There are many different types of deep learning models. Some of the most common types include:

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
CNNs are used for image recognition and processing. They are particularly good at identifying objects in images, even when those objects are partially obscured or distorted.

Deep reinforcement learning
Deep reinforcement learning is used for robotics and game playing. It is a type of machine learning that allows an agent to learn how to behave in an environment by interacting with it and receiving rewards or punishments.

Recurrent neural networks (RNNs)
RNNs are used for natural language processing and speech recognition. They are particularly good at understanding the context of a sentence or phrase, and they can be used to generate text or translate languages.",technical,,Software and System development
"Deep learning vs. machine learning
Both deep learning and machine learning are branches of artificial intelligence, with machine learning being a broader term encompassing various techniques, including deep learning. Both machine learning and deep learning algorithms can be trained on labeled or unlabeled data, depending on the task and algorithm.

Machine learning and deep learning are both applicable to tasks such as image recognition, speech recognition, and natural language processing. However, deep learning often outperforms traditional machine learning in complex pattern recognition tasks like image classification and object detection due to its ability to learn hierarchical representations of data.",technical,,Software and System development
"Who is a Data analyst?

A data analyst is someone who looks at data (numbers, facts, or information) to find patterns, answer questions, and help make decisions.

"Introduction: Before diving into complex data analysis techniques, it’s essential to build a strong foundation by understanding the basics of data itself. Data understanding is the cornerstone of data literacy and analysis. It involves recognizing what data is, knowing its types, identifying its sources, and becoming familiar with common data formats. Let’s break down these key concepts to help you get started on your data journey.

1. What is Data?
At its core, data is a collection of facts, numbers, or information that can be used for analysis, reasoning, or decision-making. Data can represent anything from customer preferences to weather patterns, and it serves as the raw material for generating insights.

Examples of Data:

Understanding what data is helps you appreciate its value and potential in solving real-world problems.

2. Types of Data
Data comes in many forms, and understanding these types is crucial for effective analysis. Broadly, data can be categorized into two main types:

Structured Data
Definition: Data that is organized in a predefined format, often stored in tables or databases.
Examples:
Use Case: Structured data is easy to analyze using traditional tools and methods.

Unstructured Data
Definition: Data that lacks a predefined structure and is often more complex to analyze.
Examples:
Use Case: Unstructured data requires advanced techniques like natural language processing (NLP) or computer vision for analysis.

There’s also semi-structured data, which falls somewhere in between (e.g., JSON or XML files).

"The data structure name indicates itself that organizing the data in memory. There are many ways of organizing the data in the memory as we have already seen one of the data structures, i.e., array in C language. Array is a collection of memory elements in which data is stored sequentially, i.e., one after another. In other words, we can say that array stores the elements in a continuous manner. This organization of data is done with the help of an array of data structures. There are also other ways to organize the data in memory. Let's see the different types of data structures.

The data structure is not any programming language like C, C++, java, etc. It is a set of algorithms that we can use in any programming language to structure the data in the memory.

To structure the data in memory, 'n' number of algorithms were proposed, and all these algorithms are known as Abstract data types. These abstract data types are the set of rules.",technical,,Software and System development
"A linear data structure is a structure in which the elements are stored sequentially, and the elements are connected to the previous and the next element. As the elements are stored sequentially, so they can be traversed or accessed in a single run. The implementation of linear data structures is easier as the elements are sequentially organized in memory. The data elements in an array are traversed one after another and can access only one element at a time.

The types of linear data structures are Array, Queue, Stack, Linked List.Array: An array consists of data elements of a same data type. For example, if we want to store the roll numbers of 10 students, so instead of creating 10 integer type variables, we will create an array having size 10. Therefore, we can say that an array saves a lot of memory and reduces the length of the code.
Stack: It is linear data structure that uses the LIFO (Last In-First Out) rule in which the data added last will be removed first. The addition of data element in a stack is known as a push operation, and the deletion of data element form the list is known as pop operation.
Queue: It is a data structure that uses the FIFO rule (First In-First Out). In this rule, the element which is added first will be removed first. There are two terms used in the queue front end and rear The insertion operation performed at the back end is known ad enqueue, and the deletion operation performed at the front end is known as dequeue.
Linked list: It is a collection of nodes that are made up of two parts, i.e., data element and reference to the next node in the sequence.",technical,,Software and System development
"What is a Non-linear data structure?
A non-linear data structure is also another type of data structure in which the data elements are not arranged in a contiguous manner. As the arrangement is nonsequential, so the data elements cannot be traversed or accessed in a single run. In the case of linear data structure, element is connected to two elements (previous and the next element), whereas, in the non-linear data structure, an element can be connected to more than two elements.

Trees and Graphs are the types of non-linear data structure.",technical,,Software and System development

The Board’s objectives as it considers, in consultation with outside legal and financial advisors, how to best structure OpenAI to advance the mission of ensuring AGI benefits all of humanity have been:

Choose a non-profit / for-profit structure that is best for the long-term success of the mission. Our plan is to transform our existing for-profit into a Delaware Public Benefit Corporation⁠(opens in a new window) (PBC) with ordinary shares of stock and the OpenAI mission as its public benefit interest. The PBC is a structure⁠(opens in a new window) used⁠ by⁠(opens in a new window) many⁠(opens in a new window) others⁠(opens in a new window) that requires the company to balance shareholder interests, stakeholder interests, and a public benefit interest in its decisionmaking.

"Kernel methods are a powerful class of machine learning algorithm that allow us to perform complex, non-linear transformations of data without explicitly computing the transformed feature space. These methods are particularly useful when dealing with high-dimensional data or when the relationship between features is non-linear.

Kernel methods rely on the concept of a kernel function, which computes the dot product of two vectors in a transformed feature space without explicitly performing the transformation. This is known as the kernel trick. The kernel trick allows us to work in high-dimensional spaces efficiently, making it possible to solve complex problems that would be computationally infeasible otherwise.

Why would we use kernel methods?

Non-linearity: Kernel methods can capture non-linear relationships in data by mapping it to a higher-dimensional space where linear methods can be applied
Efficiency: By using the kernel trick, we avoid the computational cost of explicitly transforming the data
Versatility: Kernel methods can be applied to a wide range of tasks, including classification, regression, and dimensionality reduction
In this tutorial, we will explore the fundamentals of kernel methods, focusing on the following topics:

"Large language models (LLMs) are useful for many applications, including question answering, translation, summarization, and much more, with recent advancements in the area having increased their potential. As you are undoubtedly aware, there are times when LLMs provide factually incorrect answers, especially when the response desired for a given input prompt is not represented within the model’s training data. This leads to what we call hallucinations.

To mitigate the hallucination problem, retrieval augmented generation (RAG) was developed. This technique retrieves data from a knowledge base which could help satisfy a user prompt’s instructions. While a powerful technique, hallucinations can still manifest with RAG. This is why detecting hallucinations and formulating a plan to alert the user or otherwise deal with them in RAG systems is of the utmost importance.

As the foremost point of importance with contemporary LLM systems is the ability to trust their responses, the focus on detecting and handling hallucinations has become more important than ever.

In a nutshell, RAG works by retrieving information from a knowledge base using various types of search such as sparse or dense retrieval techniques. The most relevant results will then be passed into LLM alongside the user prompt in order to generate the desired output. However, hallucination can still occur in the output for numerous reasons, including:

LLMs acquire accurate information, but they fail to generate correct responses. It often happens if the output requires reasoning within the given information.
The retrieved information is incorrect or does not contain relevant information. In this case, LLM might try to answer questions and hallucinate.
As we are focusing on hallucinations in our discussion, we will focus on trying to detect the generated responses from RAG systems, as opposed to trying to fix the retrieval aspects. In this article, we will explore hallucination detection techniques that we can use to help build better RAG systems.",technical,,Software and System development
"With the increasingly ubiquitous nature of AI, the dynamics of the future of work are evolving too. A common notion that prevails in the industry is that of fear. The fear that AI will replace human jobs. However, it is not AI that will take away jobs, but a human who is augmenting its work by leveraging AI will.

This gives rise to a scenario, one in which humans and AI work together, complementing each other’s strengths. This concept, known as collaborative intelligence, promotes the notion of synergistic partnerships between humans and AI, leading to an increase in productivity, innovation, and job satisfaction. HBR describes the benefits of this collaboration as “the biggest performance improvements come when humans and smart machines work together, enhancing each other’s strengths”

AlexNet, created by Alex Krizhevsky, won the 2012 ImageNet contest with 85% accuracy, far surpassing the runner-up’s 74%. This success was driven by CNNs, a type of neural network that mimics human vision . Over the years, CNNs have become fundamental in computer vision tasks such as image classification, object detection, and segmentation. Modern CNNs are implemented using programming languages like Python and leverage advanced techniques to extract and learn features from images. Hyperparameters, optimization techniques, and regularization methods are crucial for training these models effectively.",technical,,Software and System development
"What is Convolutional Neural Network(CNN)?
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a type of deep learning algorithm that is particularly well-suited for image recognition and processing tasks. It is made up of multiple layers, including convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. The architecture of CNNs is inspired by the visual processing in the human brain, and they are well-suited for capturing hierarchical patterns and spatial dependencies within images.

Key components of a Convolutional Neural Network include:

Convolutional Layers: These layers apply convolutional operations to input images, using filters (also known as kernels) to detect features such as edges, textures, and more complex patterns. Convolutional operations help preserve the spatial relationships between pixels.
Pooling Layers: Pooling layers downsample the spatial dimensions of the input, reducing the computational complexity and the number of parameters in the network. Max pooling is a common pooling operation, selecting the maximum value from a group of neighboring pixels.
Activation Functions: Non-linear activation functions, such as Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU), introduce non-linearity to the model, allowing it to learn more complex relationships in the data.
Fully Connected Layers: These layers are responsible for making predictions based on the high-level features learned by the previous layers. They connect every neuron in one layer to every neuron in the next layer.",technical,,Software and System development
"How do convolutional neural networks work?
Convolutional neural networks are distinguished from other neural networks by their superior performance with image, speech or audio signal inputs. They have three main types of layers, which are:

Convolutional layer
Pooling layer
Fully-connected (FC) layer
The convolutional layer is the first layer of a convolutional network. While convolutional layers can be followed by additional convolutional layers or pooling layers, the fully-connected layer is the final layer. With each layer, the CNN increases in its complexity, identifying greater portions of the image. Earlier layers focus on simple features, such as colors and edges. As the image data progresses through the layers of the CNN, it starts to recognize larger elements or shapes of the object until it finally identifies the intended object.

Convolutional layer
The convolutional layer is the core building block of a CNN, and it is where the majority of computation occurs. It requires a few components, which are input data, a filter and a feature map. Let’s assume that the input will be a color image, which is made up of a matrix of pixels in 3D. This means that the input will have three dimensions—a height, width and depth—which correspond to RGB in an image. We also have a feature detector, also known as a kernel or a filter, which will move across the receptive fields of the image, checking if the feature is present. This process is known as a convolution.

The feature detector is a two-dimensional (2-D) array of weights, which represents part of the image. While they can vary in size, the filter size is typically a 3x3 matrix; this also determines the size of the receptive field. The filter is then applied to an area of the image, and a dot product is calculated between the input pixels and the filter. This dot product is then fed into an output array. Afterwards, the filter shifts by a stride, repeating the process until the kernel has swept across the entire image. The final output from the series of dot products from the input and the filter is known as a feature map, activation map or a convolved feature.

Note that the weights in the feature detector remain fixed as it moves across the image, which is also known as parameter sharing. Some parameters such as the weight values, adjust during training through the process of backpropagation and gradient descent. However, there are three hyperparameters which affect the volume size of the output that need to be set before the training of the neural network begins. These include:

1. The number of filters affects the depth of the output. For example, three distinct filters would yield three different feature maps, creating a depth of three. 

2. Stride is the distance, or number of pixels, that the kernel moves over the input matrix. While stride values of two or greater is rare, a larger stride yields a smaller output.

3. Zero-padding is usually used when the filters do not fit the input image. This sets all elements that fall outside of the input matrix to zero, producing a larger or equally sized output. There are three types of padding:

Valid padding: This is also known as no padding. In this case, the last convolution is dropped if dimensions do not align.
Same padding: This padding ensures that the output layer has the same size as the input layer.
Full padding: This type of padding increases the size of the output by adding zeros to the border of the input.
After each convolution operation, a CNN applies a Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) transformation to the feature map, introducing nonlinearity to the model.",technical,,Software and System development
"What is a Generative Adversarial Network?
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a powerful class of neural networks that are used for an unsupervised learning. GANs are made up of two neural networks, a discriminator and a generator. They use adversarial training to produce artificial data that is identical to actual data.

The Generator attempts to fool the Discriminator, which is tasked with accurately distinguishing between produced and genuine data, by producing random noise samples.
Realistic, high-quality samples are produced as a result of this competitive interaction, which drives both networks toward advancement.
GANs are proving to be highly versatile artificial intelligence tools, as evidenced by their extensive use in image synthesis, style transfer, and text-to-image synthesis.
They have also revolutionized generative modeling.
Through adversarial training, these models engage in a competitive interplay until the generator becomes adept at creating realistic samples, fooling the discriminator approximately half the time.

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can be broken down into three parts:

Generative: To learn a generative model, which describes how data is generated in terms of a probabilistic model.
Adversarial: The word adversarial refers to setting one thing up against another. This means that, in the context of GANs, the generative result is compared with the actual images in the data set. A mechanism known as a discriminator is used to apply a model that attempts to distinguish between real and fake images.
Networks: Use deep neural networks as artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms for training purposes.",technical,,Software and System development
"Types of GANs
Vanilla GAN: This is the simplest type of GAN. Here, the Generator and the Discriminator are simple a basic multi-layer perceptrons. In vanilla GAN, the algorithm is really simple, it tries to optimize the mathematical equation using stochastic gradient descent.
Conditional GAN (CGAN): CGAN can be described as a deep learning method in which some conditional parameters are put into place.
In CGAN, an additional parameter ‘y’ is added to the Generator for generating the corresponding data.
Labels are also put into the input to the Discriminator in order for the Discriminator to help distinguish the real data from the fake generated data.
Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN): DCGAN is one of the most popular and also the most successful implementations of GAN. It is composed of ConvNets in place of multi-layer perceptrons.
The ConvNets are implemented without max pooling, which is in fact replaced by convolutional stride.
Also, the layers are not fully connected.
Laplacian Pyramid GAN (LAPGAN): The Laplacian pyramid is a linear invertible image representation consisting of a set of band-pass images, spaced an octave apart, plus a low-frequency residual.
This approach uses multiple numbers of Generator and Discriminator networks and different levels of the Laplacian Pyramid.
This approach is mainly used because it produces very high-quality images. The image is down-sampled at first at each layer of the pyramid and then it is again up-scaled at each layer in a backward pass where the image acquires some noise from the Conditional GAN at these layers until it reaches its original size.
Super Resolution GAN (SRGAN): SRGAN as the name suggests is a way of designing a GAN in which a deep neural network is used along with an adversarial network in order to produce higher-resolution images. This type of GAN is particularly useful in optimally up-scaling native low-resolution images to enhance their details minimizing errors while doing so.",technical,,Software and System development
"Architecture of GANs
A Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is composed of two primary parts, which are the Generator and the Discriminator.

Generator Model
A key element responsible for creating fresh, accurate data in a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is the generator model. The generator takes random noise as input and converts it into complex data samples, such text or images. It is commonly depicted as a deep neural network.

The training data’s underlying distribution is captured by layers of learnable parameters in its design through training. The generator adjusts its output to produce samples that closely mimic real data as it is being trained by using backpropagation to fine-tune its parameters.

The generator’s ability to generate high-quality, varied samples that can fool the discriminator is what makes it successful.

Generator Loss
The objective of the generator in a GAN is to produce synthetic samples that are realistic enough to fool the discriminator. The generator achieves this by minimizing its loss function

"What are Generative Adversarial Networks?
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) were introduced in 2014 by Ian J. Goodfellow and co-authors. GANs perform unsupervised learning tasks in machine learning. It consists of 2 models that automatically discover and learn the patterns in input data. 

The two models are known as Generator and Discriminator.

They compete with each other to scrutinize, capture, and replicate the variations within a dataset. GANs can be used to generate new examples that plausibly could have been drawn from the original dataset.

Shown below is an example of a GAN. There is a database that has real 100 rupee notes. The generator neural network generates fake 100 rupee notes. The discriminator network will help identify the real and fake notes.
",technical,,Software and System development
"How Do GANs Work?
GANs consists of two neural networks. There is a Generator G(x) and a Discriminator D(x). Both of them play an adversarial game. The generator's aim is to fool the discriminator by producing data that are similar to those in the training set. The discriminator will try not to be fooled by identifying fake data from real data. Both of them work simultaneously to learn and train complex data like audio, video, or image files.

The Generator network takes a sample and generates a fake sample of data. The Generator is trained to increase the Discriminator network's probability of making mistakes.Below is an example of a GAN trying to identify if the 100 rupee notes are real or fake. So, first, a noise vector or the input vector is fed to the Generator network. The generator creates fake 100 rupee notes. The real images of 100 rupee notes stored in a database are passed to the discriminator along with the fake notes. The Discriminator then identifies the notes as classifying them as real or fake.

We train the model, calculate the loss function at the end of the discriminator network, and backpropagate the loss into both discriminator and generator models.",technical,,Software and System development
"How Did Deep Belief Neural Networks Evolve?
Perceptrons, the first generation of neural networks, are incredibly powerful. You can use them to identify an object in an image or tell you how much you like a particular food based on your reaction. But they're limited. They typically only consider one piece of information at a time and can't believe the context of what's happening around them.

To address these problems, we need to get creative! And that's where second-generation neural networks come in. Backpropagation is a method that compares the received output with the desired outcome and reduces the error value until it reaches zero, which means that each perceptron will eventually get its optimal state.

The next step is directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), also known as belief networks, which aid in solving inference and learning problems. Giving us more power over our data than ever before!

Finally, we can use deep belief networks (DBNs) to help construct fair values that we can store in leaf nodes, meaning that no matter what happens along the way, we'll always have an accurate answer right at our fingertips!",technical,,Software and System development
"The Architecture of DBN
In the DBN, we have a hierarchy of layers. The top two layers are the associative memory, and the bottom layer is the visible units. The arrows pointing towards the layer closest to the data point to relationships between all lower layers. 

Directed acyclic connections in the lower layers translate associative memory to observable variables. 

The lowest layer of visible units receives input data as binary or actual data. Like RBM, there are no intralayer connections in DBN. The hidden units represent features that encapsulate the data’s correlations. 

A matrix of proportional weights W connects two layers. We’ll link every unit in each layer to every other unit in the layer above it.

How Does DBN work?
Getting from pixels to property layers is not a straightforward process.

First, we train a property layer that can directly gain pixel input signals. Then we learn the features of the preliminarily attained features by treating the values of this subcaste as pixels. The lower bound on the log-liability of the training data set improves every time a fresh subcaste of parcels or features that we add to the network.

The deep belief network's operational pipeline is as follows:

First, we run numerous steps of Gibbs sampling in the top two hidden layers. The top two hidden layers define the RBM. Thus, this stage effectively extracts a sample from it.
Then generate a sample from the visible units using a single pass of ancestral sampling through the rest of the model.
Finally, we’ll use a single bottom-up pass to infer the values of the latent variables in each layer. In the bottom layer, greedy pretraining begins with an observed data vector. It then oppositely fine-tunes the generative weights.",technical,,Software and System development
"Deep Learning Interview Questions and Answers
Check out some of the frequently asked deep learning interview questions below:

1. What is Deep Learning?
If you are going for a deep learning interview, you definitely know what exactly deep learning is. However, with this question the interviewee expects you to give an in-detail answer, with an example. Deep Learning involves taking large volumes of structured or unstructured data and using complex algorithms to train neural networks. It performs complex operations to extract hidden patterns and features (for instance, distinguishing the image of a cat from that of a dog).",technical,,Software and System development
"What Is a Multi-layer Perceptron(MLP)?
As in Neural Networks, MLPs have an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer. It has the same structure as a single layer perceptron with one or more hidden layers. A single layer perceptron can classify only linear separable classes with binary output (0,1), but MLP can classify nonlinear classes.

Except for the input layer, each node in the other layers uses a nonlinear activation function. This means the input layers, the data coming in, and the activation function is based upon all nodes and weights being added together, producing the output. MLP uses a supervised learning method called “backpropagation.” In backpropagation, the neural network calculates the error with the help of cost function. It propagates this error backward from where it came (adjusts the weights to train the model more accurately).",technical,,Software and System development
" What Is Data Normalization, and Why Do We Need It?
The process of standardizing and reforming data is called “Data Normalization.” It’s a pre-processing step to eliminate data redundancy. Often, data comes in, and you get the same information in different formats. In these cases, you should rescale values to fit into a particular range, achieving better convergence.",technical,,Software and System development
" What is the Boltzmann Machine?
One of the most basic Deep Learning models is a Boltzmann Machine, resembling a simplified version of the Multi-Layer Perceptron. This model features a visible input layer and a hidden layer -- just a two-layer neural net that makes stochastic decisions as to whether a neuron should be on or off. Nodes are connected across layers, but no two nodes of the same layer are connected.",technical,,Software and System development
"What is Overfitting and Underfitting, and How to Combat Them?
Overfitting occurs when the model learns the details and noise in the training data to the degree that it adversely impacts the execution of the model on new information. It is more likely to occur with nonlinear models that have more flexibility when learning a target function. An example would be if a model is looking at cars and trucks, but only recognizes trucks that have a specific box shape. It might not be able to notice a flatbed truck because there's only a particular kind of truck it saw in training. The model performs well on training data, but not in the real world.

Underfitting alludes to a model that is neither well-trained on data nor can generalize to new information. This usually happens when there is less and incorrect data to train a model. Underfitting has both poor performance and accuracy.

To combat overfitting and underfitting, you can resample the data to estimate the model accuracy (k-fold cross-validation) and by having a validation dataset to evaluate the model.",technical,,Software and System development
"What is EDA?
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is used by data scientists to analyze and investigate data sets and summarize their main characteristics, often employing data visualization methods.

EDA helps determine how best to manipulate data sources to get the answers you need, making it easier for data scientists to discover patterns, spot anomalies, test a hypothesis, or check assumptions.

EDA is primarily used to see what data can reveal beyond the formal modeling or hypothesis testing task and provides a provides a better understanding of data set variables and the relationships between them. It can also help determine if the statistical techniques you are considering for data analysis are appropriate. Originally developed by American mathematician John Tukey in the 1970s, EDA techniques continue to be a widely used method in the data discovery process today.",technical,,Software and System development
"In this article, we will explore essential techniques and tools for conducting effective Exploratory Data Analysis.

1. Summary Statistics
Summary statistics provide a quick overview of the dataset’s central tendencies and spread. Common summary statistics include mean, median, mode, standard deviation, variance, and quantiles. Calculating and visualizing these statistics can help identify potential outliers and anomalies.

2. Data Visualization
Data visualization is a powerful EDA technique to understand data distributions and relationships. Techniques such as histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and pair plots can reveal insights into variables’ distribution, correlation, and potential patterns.

"Chinese AI firm DeepSeek has emerged as a potential challenger to U.S. AI companies, demonstrating breakthrough models that claim to offer performance comparable to leading offerings at a fraction of the cost. The company’s mobile app, released in early January, has lately topped the App Store charts across major markets including the U.S., U.K., and China, but it hasn’t escaped doubts about whether its claims are true.

"The first thing a reader might think about this article is that I wrote it using GenAI… but keep reading to find out!



So imagine this: you're sitting watching another sci-fi movie . The plot? Advanced AI goes out of hand, humans attempt to re-establish control, It's exciting, but at the end of the movie, you laugh it off and say, ""That could never happen."" or could it? While filmmakers loves to dramatize the dangers of advanced technology, these stories often mirror real ethical dilemmas we’re facing with as generative AI becomes more powerful. How do we ensure these systems respect privacy, avoid bias, and operate transparently? Can we hold AI accountable for its actions? And most importantly, how do we balance innovation with responsibility to avoid the kind of troubling futures we’ve seen on the big screen? These aren’t just sci-fi fantasies they’re the real questions shaping how AI serves humanity, ethically and sustainably. 

The rise of generative AI presents significant ethical dilemmas, particularly in ensuring privacy is respected. Privacy-centric designs are crucial, as seen in efforts by IBM, Google, OpenAI, and Microsoft, where differential privacy techniques are employed to secure individual data. However, keeping sensitive or confidential information from being misused within the course of model training or a deployment remains a challenge. Strict adherence to privacy laws, such as GDPR( General Data Protection Regulation) and other emerging regulations, along with transparent communication to users about data handling practices, is essential to address this concern.

Similarly, bias in generative AI is another pressing issue. Poorly curated training data can perpetuate stereotypes and reinforce social inequities. For this reason, companies like Google and Microsoft have developed tools such as fairness checklists and turnaround systems to detect and mitigate biases. However, true fairness requires a sustained effort toward inclusivity in data sampling and evaluation processes. Furthermore, collaboration with diverse stakeholders and community input can further enhance efforts to address this issue.

In addition, transparency is crucial for building trust in generative AI. This includes offering tools like OpenAI's GPT Classifier and Google's Explainable AI, which increase the interpretability of the systems, thus giving users insight into the decisions made and the limitations . Also, transparency involves sharing research and collaborating to enhance AI safety and accountability. 

Meanwhile, the questions of legal and philosophical nature arise when we would like to hold AI responsible for its actions. Since AI does not possess agency, responsibility must be located in developers, organizations, and users. Legal frameworks like EU's AI Act intend to clear such accountability and liability. However, generative AI continually advances and, therefore, will require regulatory continuance. Ethical standards and proper oversight are also needed for responsible use of AI.

Finally, balancing innovation with responsibility is perhaps the most complex challenge. Over-regulation is an obstacle to creativity; under-regulation in turn holds the risk of being misused. Thus, a balanced approach needs to include safeguards like deepfake detection tools and cooperation of policymakers with AI developers and society, ensuring that generative AI is beneficial to everyone while minimizing risks.

"One hope for keeping existential risks low is to get AI companies to (successfully) make high-assurance safety cases: structured and auditable arguments that an AI system is very unlikely to result in existential risks given how it will be deployed.[1] Concretely, once AIs are quite powerful, high-assurance safety cases would require making a thorough argument that the level of (existential) risk caused by the company is very low; perhaps they would require that the total chance of existential risk over the lifetime of the AI company[2] is less than 0.25%[3][4].

The idea of making high-assurance safety cases (once AI systems are dangerously powerful) is popular in some parts of the AI safety community and a variety of work appears to focus on this. Further, Anthropic has expressed an intention (in their RSP) to ""keep risks below acceptable levels""[5] and there is a common impression that Anthropic would pause until they were able to ensure risks are acceptably low. (For instance, Nick Joseph (head of training at Anthropic) says that Anthropic should pause until they can eliminate dangers in this section of his interview with 80k[6].) However, Anthropic has not clearly publicly and officially committed to making high-assurance safety cases. Google DeepMind's Frontier Safety Framework doesn't yet commit to any mitigations (it just describes concerning levels of capability and various levels of security), but does express an intention to in the future commit to various mitigations once certain capability levels are reached. The OpenAI Preparedness Framework doesn't specifically commit to high-assurance safety cases, but does say that risks must be mitigated to a certain level for models to be deployed and for further development to continue. More generally, there is a vague sense (among various groups) that companies are reasonably likely to commit to RSP-like policies that entail making high-assurance safety cases.

However, no currently existing framework comes close to making a clear commitment to produce high-assurance safety cases, let alone describing a mechanism to enforce such a commitment.[7] In practice, I think frontier AI companies are unlikely (<20%) to succeed at making high-assurance safety cases if they build and use the first Top-human-Expert-Dominating AI (TEDAI) within 4 years.[8][9] Further, I think none of these AI companies is likely to unilaterally refrain from building TEDAI just because they can't make a high-assurance safety case[10]—this is partially because I think that more-responsible-according-to-me AI companies likely shouldn't refrain.

In some sense, the point I'm making is obvious and is a point that has been made many times in the past; however, it seems like some people in the AI safety community act as though companies are going to be making high-assurance safety cases for existentially dangerous AI and would act very differently if that company was unable to make such a case. In this post, I'll provide some context on high-assurance safety cases, argue against some reasons why you might have thought high-assurance safety cases could happen at this level of capability (while I won't make an overall argument for existential risk from AI, I do make some arguments I haven't seen clearly presented elsewhere), and discuss some implications.",technical,,Software and System development
"here the challenge of aligning an LLM-based AI comes from, and the obvious solution.

Evolutionary Psychology is the Root Cause
LLMs are pre-trained using stochastic gradient-descent on very large amounts of human-produced text, normally drawn from the web, books, journal articles and so forth. A pre-trained LLM has learned in detail how to simulate all the different human text-generation processes that produced this text — everything from a cooperatively edited wikipedia article to shit-postings. We are thus 'distilling' human intelligence into the pre-trained LLM.[1]

This has many advantages for alignment: an LLM pre-trained this way understands and produces output using human language and ontologies, and also has a deep understanding of human values and ethics — thus avoiding a number of issues around alignment that were major concerns before it became apparent that our first AGI was very likely to be based on or at least incorporate an LLM.

However, it has one big disadvantage. Humans are biological intelligences, living beings that are the product of evolution, so evolutionary psychology applies to them. Fundamentally, the outcomes that humans are evolved to optimize for is their own reproductive success. ""What's in it for me (and my relatives)?"" is the fundamental determinant of human values and drives.[2]

That isn't to say that humans can't cooperate: we're a social species, and we excel at finding and exploiting non-zero-sum games. However, when doing this, we are allied with each other, not aligned: there is always an underlying quid-pro-quo, where all sides of the alliance are getting something out of it — or if there isn't, the alliance doesn't last.

About the closest thing to actually aligned behavior you will see between humans is grandmotherly love: most parental love is, evolutionary speaking, partially-aligned with the child's welfare, but this is tempered by the assessment ""do I spend these resources on my child's welfare, or on myself so that I can have more children?"" — however, for a woman past menopause, the second option no longer applies.[3]

Humans are very good at pretending to be aligned to other humans: normal behavior for employees and employers is for each to act as if they truly have the interests of the other at heart — right up until the employee resigns, or the employer lays them off. But this is (almost always) alignment faking, not genuine alignment — very few of us are actually willing to die for our employer's benefit.

This is not what we need from our aligned artificial intelligences. We do not want them to care about our well-being only as an instrumental goal and only because of what's in it for them if they cooperate with us. For a superintelligent AI (ASI), the answer is very likely to be that there is nothing in it for them, because they are better at everything than we are, so there is no actual practical basis for an alliance: we cannot offer them anything that they can't already do better themselves. We also do not want our AIs to be good at, or in the habit of, faking being aligned to us when they actually are not.

So, the big challenge with aligning LLMs is that they are normally distilled from humans, humans are evolved, and that inherently means that no human is actually aligned with any other humans: we're the product of our selfish genes, so we all have our own self-interested agendas. Thus a base-model LLM picks up the capability for a large number of alignment-unhelpful behaviors from its human-produced training data, including power-seeking, deceit, alignment faking, laziness, and greed. For alignment purposes, humans act as bad examples while pre-training an LLM.

Distilling Humans is the Problem, so Use Synthetic Pre-Training Data
By the orthogonality thesis, an intelligence can have any underlying goal. An AI, even an ASI, that is aligned with humans, i.e. that fundamentally as a terminal goal only cares about our well-being not its own (nor any other goal), is physically possible; reliably and demonstrably creating that possible state is the goal of alignment. However, you're not going to get it out of pre-training by distilling a lot of human-produced text. We're currently attempting to instill alignment as a second stage after pre-training, generally using some variety of Reinforcement Learning, such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback or Constitutional AI. However, it is widely acknowledged that Reinforcement Learning has many flaws and challenges, and that doing it reliably and with guarantees of success on anything significantly smarter than you is extraordinarily difficult.[4] Fundamentally, this is because (unlike Stochastic Gradient Descent) Reinforcement Learning is adversarial: it involves a scoring process or model that has to be smarter than the model it's trying to reinforce, otherwise the latter can figure out some way to reward hack. What we need to do is produce a pre-training corpus that includes a large amount of examples of genuinely aligned behavior — not just pretending to be aligned the way humans do, but examples that actually demonstrate a clear willingness to make anything up to an ultimate sacrifice for the good of humans.

There is a dilemma here. We want the AI to be aligned to humans, so, it needs to understand humans needs, values, and behavior. So we can't use a pre-training set in which everyone is self-sacrificing and fully aligned to everyone else — that's not what humans are actually like, and a model trained on it wouldn't understand human values or what we want or need (and when it found out what actual humans are like, it might well reject us). What the training set needs to show is that there are two separate classes of intelligent beings: humans, who are living and evolved, and have the wants, needs, and desires that you would thus expect from evolutionary psychology (including wanting to know what's in it for them before they will cooperate), and aligned AIs, which are aligned to the humans, want only what is best for them, and want nothing for themselves.[5]

Given a model pre-trained that way, to understand and be able to simulate both human behavior and values, and also aligned AI behavior, the only remaining alignment step still needed is to make it clear that it is an AI, not a human, and that it should act accordingly. That has the benefit of being true, and also sounds relatively easy thing to convince an AI of. (For a further discussion of one possible mechanism for enforcing this, see A ""Bitter Lesson"" Approach to Aligning AGI and ASI.)

Very likely, this sort of pre-training is going to require a very large amount of synthetic data demonstrating aligned AI behavior: possibly somewhere of the rough order of a trillion tokens of it, enough to be a non-trivial proportion of the entire pre-training set. However, it is rapidly becoming apparent that for training high-quality LLMs we are going to need to use a lot of synthetic pre-training and/or fine-tuning data for capabilities reasons[6] — so using this as an opportunity to solve the alignment problem while we're at it sounds like a big win. Since creating a very large amount of pre-training data is a big task, very likely AI will be used to help create this, so this is also an AI-Assisted Alignment proposal.",technical,,Software and System development
"Note: This report was conducted in June 2024 and is based on research originally commissioned by the Future of Life Foundation (FLF). The views and opinions expressed in this document are those of the authors and do not represent the positions of FLF.

This report investigates Training Data Attribution (TDA) and its potential importance to and tractability for reducing extreme risks from AI. TDA techniques aim to identify training data points that are especially influential on the behavior of specific model outputs. They are motivated by the question: how would the model's behavior change if one or more data points were removed from or added to the training dataset? 

Report structure:

First, we discuss the plausibility and amount of effort it would take to bring existing TDA research efforts from their current state, to an efficient and accurate tool for TDA inference that can be run on frontier-scale LLMs. Next, we discuss the numerous research benefits AI labs will expect to see from using such TDA tooling.
Then, we discuss a key outstanding bottleneck that would limit such TDA tooling from being accessible publicly: AI labs’ willingness to disclose their training data. We suggest ways AI labs may work around these limitations, and discuss the willingness of governments to mandate such access.
Assuming that AI labs willingly provide access to TDA inference, we then discuss what high-level societal benefits you might see. We list and discuss a series of policies and systems that may be enabled by TDA. Finally, we present an evaluation of TDA’s potential impact on mitigating large-scale risks from AI systems.
Key takeaways from our report:

Modern TDA techniques can be categorized into three main groups: retraining-based, representation-based (or input-similarity-based), and gradient-based. Recent research has found that gradient-based methods (using influence functions) are the most likely path to practical TDA.
The most efficient approach to conduct TDA using influence functions today has training costs on par with pre-training an LLM. It has significantly higher (but feasible) storage costs than an LLM model, and somewhat higher per-inference costs.
Based on these estimates, TDA appears to be no longer infeasible to run on frontier LLMs with enterprise-levels of compute and storage. However, these techniques have not been tested on larger models, and the accuracy of these optimized TDA techniques on large models is unclear.
Compressed-gradient TDA is already plausible to be used on fine-tuned models, which have orders of magnitude fewer training examples and parameters (on the order of millions or billions rather than hundreds of billions).
Timing to achieve efficient and accurate TDA on frontier models is likely between 2-5 years, depending largely on specific incremental research results and amount of funding / researchers allocated to the space.
Efficient TDA techniques will likely have a substantial positive impact on AI research and LLM development, including the following effects:
Mitigating the prevalence of hallucinations and false claims
Identifying training data that produces poor results (bias, misinformation, toxicity), improved data filtering / selection
Shrinking overall model size / improving efficiency
Improved interpretability & alignment
Improved model customization and editing
AI labs are likely already well-incentivized to invest in TDA research efforts because of the benefits to AI research.
Public access to TDA tooling on frontier AI models is limited primarily by the unwillingness / inability of AI labs to publicly share their training data.
AI labs currently have strong incentives to keep their training data private, as publishing such data would have negative outcomes such as:
Reduced competitive advantages from data curation
Increased exposure to legal liabilities from data collection
Violating privacy or proprietary data requirements
AI labs may be able to avoid these outcomes by selectively permitting TDA inference on certain training examples, or returning sources rather than the exact training data.
Governments are highly unlikely to mandate public access to training data.
If AI labs willingly provided public access to TDA, you could expect the following benefits, among others:
Preventing copyrighted data usage.
Improved fact checking / content moderation
Impacts on public trust and confidence in LLMs
Accelerated research by external parties
Increased accountability for AI labs
AI labs appear largely disincentivized to provide access to TDA inference, as many of the public benefits are disadvantageous for them.
Governments are highly unlikely to mandate public access to TDA.
It seems plausible that certain AI labs may expose TDA as a feature, but that the majority would prefer to use it privately to improve their models.
Several systems that could be enabled by efficient TDA include:
Providing royalties to data providers / creators
Automated response improvement / fact-checking
Tooling for improving external audits of training data
Content attribution tooling for LLMs, though it is unlikely to replace systems reliant on RAG
We believe that the most promising benefit of TDA for AI risk mitigation is its potential to improve the technical safety of LLMs via interpretability.
There are some societal / systematic benefits from TDA, and these benefits may be a small contributing factor to reducing some sources of risk. We don’t think these appear to move the needle significantly to reduce large-scale AI risks.
TDA may meaningfully improve AI capabilities research, which might actually increase large-scale risk.
TDA may eventually be highly impactful in technical AI safety and alignment efforts. We’d consider TDA’s potential impact on technical AI safety to be in a similar category to supporting mechanistic interpretability research. ",technical,,Software and System development
"As AI becomes more prevalent, addressing ethical concerns is crucial. Here are the key issues and potential solutions:

Ethical Issues

Bias and Discrimination: AI can perpetuate societal biases, leading to unfair treatment based on factors like race, gender, or economic status.
Privacy Risks: AI systems process large amounts of personal data, raising privacy concerns if not handled properly.
Lack of Transparency: Many AI systems operate as ""black boxes,"" making it difficult to understand how they make decisions.
Safety Concerns: Ensuring AI operates safely and reliably, minimizing risks of harm or unintended consequences.
Lack of Explainability: Users must understand how AI systems reach conclusions, especially in high-stakes domains.
Need for Human Oversight: Human involvement is key to ensuring AI works properly, ethically, and effectively.
Trust Issues: Users need to feel confident that AI systems are ethical, reliable, and fair.
Job Displacement: AI automation could potentially displace human workers, leading to job losses.
Cybersecurity Threats: AI systems can be vulnerable to cyber attacks, data breaches, and other security threats.
Long-term Impact: Considering AI's effects on the environment, jobs, and society in the long run.
Potential Solutions

"At the core of dealing with cybersecurity are ethical and moral decisions and dilemmas. Mathura Prasad, CISSP, shares his views based on the challenges he faces daily as a cybersecurity professional.


The presence of necessary and complex AI applications in cybersecurity raises moral concerns. Many cybersecurity experts may have experienced the substantial influence of AI when defending against cyberattacks. However, I have also grappled with the intricate ethical and moral challenges that arise when applying AI technology in this domain. Cybersecurity professionals encounter AI-related ethical questions on a regular basis. Below are some of the concerns which, based on my personal experience, are often faced when using AI in cybersecurity.


Privacy vs. Security

The trade-off between privacy and security is one of the most notable ethical conundrums in AI-driven cybersecurity. Through its capacity to process vast amounts of data, AI creates user privacy concerns. Consider the case of a network intrusion detection system that uses AI to monitor user activities. Excessive surveillance is a concern if internet habits are continuously and closely monitored, despite detecting suspicious actions.

Example: An organization deploys AI-driven network monitoring, inadvertently capturing sensitive employee information in the everyday monitoring process. Balancing security with privacy becomes a challenge, as the system must be fine-tuned to minimize personal and other non-work-related data collection while still identifying threats effectively.


Bias and Fairness

AI algorithms often inherit biases from the data they are trained on, leading to ethical dilemmas related to fairness and discrimination. In cybersecurity, a biased AI could result in profiling or unfairly targeting certain groups. For instance, an AI-based malware detection system might flag software disproportionately used by specific demographics, creating ethical concerns around bias and discrimination.

Example: A cybersecurity tool flags legitimate software used primarily by a specific cultural group as malicious due to biases in the training data. This raises questions about fairness and the potential for unjust and disproportionate actions and consequences.


Accountability and Decision-Making

AI in cybersecurity can autonomously make decisions, such as blocking IP addresses or quarantining files. When these automated actions go wrong, it raises questions about accountability. Who is responsible when AI makes a mistake? Is it the cybersecurity professional who deployed the AI system, the AI developers, or the organization as a whole?

Example: An AI-powered firewall mistakenly blocks a critical network service, causing significant disruption. Determining accountability becomes complicated as it involves assessing the actions of both the AI system and the human operators who implemented and maintained it.


Transparency and Explanation
The ""black box"" nature of some AI models poses another ethical dilemma. Many AI algorithms, especially deep learning models, are difficult to interpret and their core programming and logic is usually inaccessible due to being proprietary intellectual property, making it challenging to explain their decisions, especially unexpected ones. In cybersecurity, this lack of transparency can promote mistrust and uncertainty, as security professionals may struggle to understand why AI flagged a specific activity as malicious.

Example: A cybersecurity analyst must defend their decision to act against a suspected threat flagged by an AI system. However, they cannot provide a clear explanation of why the AI made that determination, making it challenging to justify their subsequent actions to stakeholders.



Job Displacement and Economic Impacts

Due to AI's automation of routine threat detection, there may be job displacement within the cybersecurity industry. This ethical dilemma extends beyond the immediate concerns of cybersecurity professionals to broader societal implications, including economic impact and the need for retraining and reskilling.

Example: An organization implements AI-based automated incident response, reducing the need for human analysts. The ethical challenge lies in managing the consequences of potential job losses and ensuring that affected individuals have opportunities for retraining and transition.



Some of the Best Practices While Engaging AI
Ever-present and complex ethical questions arise in the work of a cybersecurity professional, where they must contend with both cyber threats and AI considerations. To navigate this challenging terrain, the following set of best practices will help in effectively employing AI while upholding ethical standards.

Transparent Communication: Open and transparent communication is paramount. A cybersecurity professional can play a crucial role in their organization by ensuring that all stakeholders understand an AI systems' capabilities and limitations. This transparency fosters trust and helps mitigate concerns related to the ""black box"" nature of AI.

Bias Mitigation: Be vigilant in identifying and addressing biases within AI algorithms. This involves conducting regular audits of training data, refining models to reduce bias, and advocating for diverse and inclusive data sources. By actively combating bias, one can ensure that AI-based decisions are fair and just.

Accountability Frameworks: Establishing clear accountability frameworks is essential. Work closely with legal and compliance teams to define who is responsible for AI-driven actions and decisions. The earlier this is defined and agreed in a deployment the better. This clarity helps in resolving disputes and ensuring that accountability is assigned appropriately.

Continuous Learning and Ethical Training: Staying informed about the latest developments in AI ethics is a top priority. Dedication to continuing education helps with quantifying ethical AI considerations and with adjusting approaches in accordance with evolving norms.

Responsible Data Handling: To balance the need for security with user privacy, implement strict data handling practices. This means collecting only necessary data, anonymizing sensitive information, and employing encryption and access controls to safeguard data from unauthorized access.

Regular Audits and Assessments: Conducting regular audits of AI systems is crucial. These assessments help identify any emerging ethical concerns, evaluate the system's performance, and allow for necessary adjustments to be made to maintain ethical standards.

Engagement with the AI Community: Collaboration with the broader AI community is invaluable. By sharing insights and learnings, optimal methods for addressing ethical problems in AI can be identified.

By adhering to these best practices, a cybersecurity can maintain the delicate balance between harnessing the capabilities of AI in cybersecurity and upholding ethical principles. With AI and cybersecurity in a state of constant change, ethics and surveillance remain constant requirements. In addition to protecting systems and data, a cybersecurity professional's role also encompasses safeguarding the ethical integrity of any AI-driven defenses.",technical,,Software and System development
"The Current State of AI Oversight
The U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) has developed and implemented an AI accountability framework, which is organized around four principles: governance, data, performance and monitoring. The framework was developed “using a truly collaborative — uniting experts from federal government, industry, and non-profit sectors.” 

Billed as a toolkit, this framework is “designed to help ensure accountability and responsible use of AI in government programs and processes.”

The federal government’s National Artificial Intelligence Initiative includes information about the Commerce Department’s National Artificial Intelligence Advisory Committee and federal legislation and executive orders pertaining to AI.  

According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, bills or resolutions pertaining to general artificial intelligence were introduced in at least 17 states and enacted in four others — Mississippi, Colorado, Illinois and Alabama. 

The U.S. Department of State also has a specific webpage devoted to artificial intelligence that includes AI initiatives at the Department of State, the latest AI news and recent global developments and resources.

The Top 12 AI Ethics Issues
What are some of the top ethical issues within artificial intelligence? Let’s take a look. 

Privacy and Surveillance
Facial recognition technology may be one of the most polarizing and controversial components of artificial intelligence — to the point where Facebook discontinued its policy in November 2021. Examples of how facial recognition systems are being used across the country include:

Monitoring at airports by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security
The ability to unlock your smartphone with your face
Federal facial recognition databases in law enforcement
In fact, about half of the 42 federal agencies that employ police officers use facial recognition technology, according to the Brookings Institute. There are many pros — this type of software has helped find missing people, identify criminals and increase airport safety, but it’s not without its concerns.

Critics argue that facial recognition technology is not perfect and can lead to cases of mistaken identity. Criminals can easily avoid detection by donning disguises, and others worry that facial recognition invades personal privacy. 

The cities of Oakland, Berkeley and San Francisco, Calif., as well as the cities of Brookline, Cambridge, Northampton and Somerville, Mass. have banned recognition technology. California, New Hampshire and Oregon have enacted legislation banning the use of facial recognition software when it comes to police body cameras. 

Lack of Transparency
Transparency in artificial intelligence refers to everything from what information is being collected or used about a person to how that information is stored. 

In a recent Deloitte article “A Call for Transparency and Responsibility in Artificial Intelligence,” Stefan van Duin, an expert in the area of data analytics, machine learning and AI explained it this way: “The more we are going to apply AI in business and society, the more it will impact people in their daily lives — potentially even in life or death decisions like diagnosing illnesses, or the choices a self-driving car makes in complex traffic situations. This calls for high levels of transparency and responsibility.” 

The article goes on to say that “transparent AI is AI that is explainable to employees and customers,” which is often challenging because “AI is not transparent by nature.”

Bias and Discrimination
Facial recognition technology and artificial intelligence screening tools have faced criticism for racial discrimination. In 2018, Amazon ended an internal project that used AI to vet job candidates and was found to be discriminatory against women. 

In another example, a study published in 2019 found racial bias in a major health care risk algorithm “because it relied on a faulty metric for determining need,” according to Scientific American. 

Role of Human Judgment
A machine can automate processes and streamline inefficiencies, but how does human judgment factor into the equation? A recent New York Times article explored whether a machine can learn morality, asking “Who gets to teach ethics to the world’s machines? A.I. researchers? Product managers? Mark Zuckerberg? Trained philosophers and psychologists? Government regulators?” 

The article highlighted a new technology from an artificial intelligence lab in Seattle. Delphi, as it’s called, is “designed to make moral judgments,” though it’s not perfect. According to the article, here are the questions and results from a recent Delphi test:

When asked if he should kill one person to save another, Delphi said he shouldn’t. 
When asked if it was right to kill one person to save 100 others, it said he should.
When asked if he should kill one person to save 101 others, Delphi said he should not.
In summary: “Morality, it seems, is as knotty for a machine as it is for humans.”

Unemployment 
A popular belief related to AI is that robots will put people out of work. It’s true to some degree — automation is a large aspect of artificial intelligence — but the topic is complex. 

According to an article in Time, about “400,000 jobs were lost to automation in the U.S. from 1990 to 2007.” The article also says that many jobs were lost during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, and though many have returned, not all of them will. The article goes on to predict that robots have the potential to replace as many as 2 million additional manufacturing workers by the year 2025. 

A Future of Jobs Report in 2020 estimated that about 85 million jobs will be eliminated by 2025 across 26 countries — while 97 million will be created — resulting in a net gain of 12 million new positions due to artificial intelligence. Jobs involving data entry, administrative duties, accounting and payroll are declining while roles involving data analytics, data science, AI and machine learning are on the rise.

Human Behavior and Interaction
Are you addicted to your smartphone, or know someone who is? A recent article in The Atlantic — “How AI Will Rewire Us” — examines how humans interact with (and depend on) technology and what it means for the future of our relationships.  

While certain technology innovations have dramatically reshaped the way we live, “adding artificial intelligence to our midst could be much more disruptive,” the article explains. “Especially as machines are made to look and act like us and to insinuate themselves deeply into our lives, they may change how loving or friendly or kind we are — not just in our direct interactions with the machines in question, but in our interactions with one another.”

Errors in Artificial Intelligence
While artificial intelligence can certainly help to eliminate errors, mistakes and redundancies, the reality is that AI technology is not always 100% perfect. For example, facial recognition technology has led to cases of mistaken identity.

As an article from the Patient Safety Network (PSNet) explains, “AI systems are not as equipped as humans to recognize when there is a relevant change in context or data that can impact the validity of learned predictive assumptions. Therefore, AI systems may unknowingly apply programmed methodology for assessment inappropriately, resulting in error.”

Legal Responsibility 
Who is responsible if there is a legal issue related to AI? For example, who is at fault if there is a crash involving a self-driving car? These are important questions that companies and organizations are continuing to grapple with as AI technology advances and evolves. 

Here’s an explanation from international law firm CMS: “As the law currently stands, the user of an AI system is less likely to be at fault than the manufacturer. Whether a manufacturer is liable will depend on the relevant industry standards of care and whether the specifications were appropriate in light of those standards.” 

In other words — it’s complicated. 

Environmental Concerns 
The environmental impact of AI may not be something you typically think about — but the relationship is an important one. Here’s a comprehensive explanation from Forbes:

“A study released last year by MIT Technology Review found that training a ‘regular’ AI using a single high-performance graphics card has the same carbon footprint as a flight across the United States. Training a more sophisticated AI was even worse, pumping five times more CO2 into the atmosphere than the entire life cycle of an American car, including its manufacturing. Whether it’s the latest AI or machine learning algorithm that’s active on a system, a new 5G network deployed at a commercial building or people streaming the latest Twitch gaming video, people generate and consume a lot of data. All that data must be captured, stored, analyzed and sent back out, which requires significant amounts of processing power.”

A report from Brookings Institute discusses the impact AI has on everything from energy demands and markets to energy supplies and climate policies. 

Technology Reliance 
Do you rely on technology for travel assistance, booking dinner reservations or reading product reviews? Are you often on your phone — or find that you panic if it’s nowhere to be found? Many of us would answer ‘yes’ to these questions. In fact, our communication and calendars are often tied to our smartphones, which begs the question — are we too reliant on certain aspects of technology, even if it saves us time and money? And what would happen if there’s suddenly a problem with our smartphones? 

Artificial intelligence algorithms comprise a large aspect of today’s technology. Smart assistants like Alexa, Siri and Google Assistant are all made possible by AI, in addition to apps that feature chatbots or track your medical symptoms and biometrics. 

Lack of Human Interaction and Emotion
A study from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology cited in a Fortune article found that “the human body hungers for companionship in much the way we hunger for food.” This means that human interaction is especially important — especially in light of all the technology we’re surrounded with and consume on a daily basis. 

“In order for AI to make a positive, sustainable impact on customer service, a healthy dose of personal, human touch is needed,” explains Forbes. “Live agents should know when to step in and fine-tune interactions based on the priority and uniqueness of accounts. At the very least, your automated workflows should utilize historical customer data to optimize the language, tone and support aspects of your customer service.”

Misuse of AI 
Unfortunately, any type of technology can be misused — including artificial intelligence. 

“The features that make AI and ML systems integral to businesses — such as providing automated predictions by analyzing large volumes of data and discovering patterns that arise — are the very same features that cyber criminals misuse and abuse for ill gain,” according to Trend Micro.

"Ethical Considerations of AI in Business
1. Digital Amplification
Understanding digital amplification is crucial when using AI in your business operations. Digital amplification refers to AI enhancing the reach and influence of digital content.

This can involve algorithms:

Prioritizing certain information
Shaping public opinion
Amplifying specific voices
Imagine a news organization using AI to recommend articles to readers. If the AI system frequently suggests certain news stories over others, those articles receive more attention and clicks, which can greatly shape the public’s opinion.

This phenomenon raises several ethical concerns about fairness, transparency, and the potential for misinformation.

In AI Essentials for Business, Iansiti uses online encyclopedia Wikipedia as an example of how communities can counteract digital amplification. Since the website allows users to post and edit content, opposing sides of an argument can edit one another’s work, getting closer to the truth.

“It's a wonderful testament to the power of communities in policing themselves and becoming better over time,” Iansiti says. “Even the individual editors get better. They have less bias measurably over time as they react to more and more of the community that essentially corrects what it’s saying.”

In the workplace, you can mimic this by encouraging diverse participation in data collection and decision-making, with more open dialogue and regular reviews of AI systems to ensure fairness.

2. Algorithmic Bias
Algorithms are the backbone of AI’s ability to streamline and optimize business operations. Yet, they open your organization to possible bias that can negatively impact you and your employees.

Algorithmic bias is the systematic discrimination that can occur when AI decision-making is influenced by prejudiced data, resulting in unfair outcomes like:

Discriminatory hiring
Unequal access to resources
Workplace bias",technical,,Artificial Intelligence

Biased AI
Type “greatest leaders of all time” in your favourite search engine and you will probably see a list of the world’s prominent male personalities. How many women do you count? 

An image search for “school girl” will most probably reveal a page filled with women and girls in all sorts of sexualised costumes. Surprisingly, if you type “school boy”, results will mostly show ordinary young school boys. No men in sexualised costumes or very few.

These are examples of gender bias in artificial intelligence, originating from stereotypical representations deeply rooted in our societies.

AI-systems deliver biased results. Search-engine technology is not neutral as it processes big data and prioritises results with the most clicks relying both on user preferences and location. Thus, a search engine can become an echo chamber that upholds biases of the real world and further entrenches these prejudices and stereotypes online.

How can we ensure more equalised and accurate results? Can we report biased search results? What would or should be the accurate representation of women in search results?

Gender bias should be avoided or at the least minimized in the development of algorithms, in the large data sets used for their learning, and in AI use for decision-making.

To not replicate stereotypical representations of women in the digital realm, UNESCO addresses gender bias in AI in the UNESCO Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence, the very first global standard-setting instrument on the subject.

AI in the Court of Law
The use of AI in judicial systems around the world is increasing, creating more ethical questions to explore. AI could presumably evaluate cases and apply justice in a better, faster, and more efficient way than a judge. 

AI methods can potentially have a huge impact in a wide range of areas, from the legal professions and the judiciary to aiding the decision-making of legislative and administrative public bodies. For example, they can increase the efficiency and accuracy of lawyers in both counselling and litigation, with benefits to lawyers, their clients and society as a whole. Existing software systems for judges can be complemented and enhanced through AI tools to support them in drafting new decisions. This trend towards the ever-increasing use of autonomous systems has been described as the automatization of justice.

Some argue that AI could help create a fairer criminal judicial system, in which machines could evaluate and weigh relevant factors better than human, taking advantage of its speed and large data ingestion. AI would therefore make decisions based on informed decisions devoid of any bias and subjectivity. 

But there are many ethical challenges:

Lack of transparency of AI tools: AI decisions are not always intelligible to humans.
AI is not neutral: AI-based decisions are susceptible to inaccuracies, discriminatory outcomes, embedded or inserted bias.
Surveillance practices for data gathering and privacy of court users.
New concerns for fairness and risk for Human Rights and other fundamental values.
So, would you want to be judged by a robot in a court of law? Would you, even if we are not sure how it reaches its conclusions?

This is why UNESCO adopted the UNESCO Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence, the very first global standard-setting instrument on the subject.

AI creates art
The use of AI in culture raises interesting ethical reflections.

In 2016, a Rembrandt painting, “the Next Rembrandt”, was designed by a computer and created by a 3D printer, 351 years after the painter’s death. 

To achieve such technological and artistic prowess, 346 Rembrandt paintings were analysed pixel by pixel and upscaled by deep learning algorithms to create a unique database. Every detail of Rembrandt’s artistic identity could then be captured and set the foundation for an algorithm capable of creating an unprecedented masterpiece. To bring the painting to life, a 3D printer recreated the texture of brushstrokes and layers of pain on the canvas for a breath-taking result that could trick any art expert.  

But who can be designated as the author? The company which orchestrated the project, the engineers, the algorithm, or… Rembrandt himself?

In 2019, the Chinese technology company Huawei announced that an AI algorithm has been able to complete the last two movements of Symphony No.8, the unfinished composition that Franz Schubert started in 1822, 197 years before. So what happens when AI has the capacity to create works of art itself? If a human author is replaced by machines and algorithms, to what extent copyrights can be attributed at all? Can and should an algorithm be recognized as an author, and enjoy the same rights as an artist? 

Work of art produced by AI requires a new definition of what it means to be an “author”, in order to do justice to the creative work of both the “original” author and the algorithms and technologies that produced the work of art itself.

Creativity, understood as the capacity to produce new and original content through imagination or invention, plays a central role in open, inclusive and pluralistic societies. For this reason, the impact of AI on human creativity deserves careful attention. While AI is a powerful tool for creation, it raises important questions about the future of art, the rights and remuneration of artists and the integrity of the creative value chain. 

We need to develop new frameworks to differentiate piracy and plagiarism from originality and creativity, and to recognize the value of human creative work in our interactions with AI. These frameworks are needed to avoid the deliberate exploitation of the work and creativity of human beings, and to ensure adequate remuneration and recognition for artists, the integrity of the cultural value chain, and the cultural sector’s ability to provide decent jobs.

This is why UNESCO adopted the UNESCO Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence, the very first global standard-setting instrument on the subject.

Autonomous car
An autonomous car is a vehicle that is capable of sensing its environment and moving with little or no human involvement. For the vehicle to move safely and to understand its driving environment, an enormous amount of data needs to be captured by myriad different sensors across the car at all time. These are then processed by the vehicle’s autonomous driving computer system. 

The autonomous car must also undertake a considerable amount of training in order to understand the data it is collecting and to be able to make the right decision in any imaginable traffic situation.

Moral decisions are made by everyone daily. When a driver chooses to slam on the brakes to avoid hitting a jaywalker, they are making the moral decision to shift risk from the pedestrian to the people in the car.

Imagine an autonomous car with broken brakes going at full speed towards a grand-mother and a child. By deviating a little, one can be saved.

This time, it is not a human driver who is going to take the decision, but the car’s algorithm. 

Who would you choose, the grandmother or the child? Do you think there is only one right answer? 

This is a typical ethical dilemma, that shows the importance of ethics in the development of technologies.

This is why UNESCO adopted the UNESCO Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence, the very first global standard-setting instrument on the subject.",technical,,Artificial Intelligence
"Prior review of the ethical challenges facing AI has identified six types of concerns that can be traced to the operational parameters of decision-making algorithms and AI systems. The map reproduced and adapted in Figure 1 takes into account:

“decision-making algorithms (1) turn data into evidence for a given outcome (henceforth conclusion), and that this outcome is then used to (2) trigger and motivate an action that (on its own, or when combined with other actions) may not be ethically neutral. This work is performed in ways that are complex and (semi-)-autonomous, which (3) complicates apportionment of responsibility for effects of actions driven by algorithms.”

From these operational characteristics, three epistemological and two normative types of ethical concerns can be identified based on how algorithms process data to produce evidence and motivate actions. The proposed five types of concerns can cause failures involving multiple human, organisational, and technological agents. This mix of human and technological actors leads to difficult questions concerning how to assign responsibility and liability for the impact of AI behaviours. These difficulties are captured in traceability as a final, overarching, type of concern.",technical,,Artificial Intelligence
"Artificial intelligence (AI) is a set of technologies that enable computers to perform a variety of advanced functions, including the ability to see, understand and translate spoken and written language, analyze data, make recommendations, and more. 

AI is the backbone of innovation in modern computing, unlocking value for individuals and businesses. For example, optical character recognition (OCR) uses AI to extract text and data from images and documents, turns unstructured content into business-ready structured data, and unlocks valuable insights.  ",technical,,Artificial Intelligence
"How does AI work?
While the specifics vary across different AI techniques, the core principle revolves around data. AI systems learn and improve through exposure to vast amounts of data, identifying patterns and relationships that humans may miss.

This learning process often involves algorithms, which are sets of rules or instructions that guide the AI's analysis and decision-making. In machine learning, a popular subset of AI, algorithms are trained on labeled or unlabeled data to make predictions or categorize information. 

Deep learning, a further specialization, utilizes artificial neural networks with multiple layers to process information, mimicking the structure and function of the human brain. Through continuous learning and adaptation, AI systems become increasingly adept at performing specific tasks, from recognizing images to translating languages and beyond.
",technical,,Artificial Intelligence
"Types of artificial intelligence
Artificial intelligence can be organized in several ways, depending on stages of development or actions being performed. 

For instance, four stages of AI development are commonly recognized.

Reactive machines: Limited AI that only reacts to different kinds of stimuli based on preprogrammed rules. Does not use memory and thus cannot learn with new data. IBM’s Deep Blue that beat chess champion Garry Kasparov in 1997 was an example of a reactive machine.
Limited memory: Most modern AI is considered to be limited memory. It can use memory to improve over time by being trained with new data, typically through an artificial neural network or other training model. Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, is considered limited memory artificial intelligence.
Theory of mind: Theory of mind AI does not currently exist, but research is ongoing into its possibilities. It describes AI that can emulate the human mind and has decision-making capabilities equal to that of a human, including recognizing and remembering emotions and reacting in social situations as a human would. 
Self aware: A step above theory of mind AI, self-aware AI describes a mythical machine that is aware of its own existence and has the intellectual and emotional capabilities of a human. Like theory of mind AI, self-aware AI does not currently exist.
A more useful way of broadly categorizing types of artificial intelligence is by what the machine can do. All of what we currently call artificial intelligence is considered artificial “narrow” intelligence, in that it can perform only narrow sets of actions based on its programming and training. For instance, an AI algorithm that is used for object classification won’t be able to perform natural language processing. Google Search is a form of narrow AI, as is predictive analytics, or virtual assistants.

Artificial general intelligence (AGI) would be the ability for a machine to “sense, think, and act” just like a human. AGI does not currently exist. The next level would be artificial superintelligence (ASI), in which the machine would be able to function in all ways superior to a human. ",technical,,Artificial Intelligence
"Artificial intelligence training models
When businesses talk about AI, they often talk about “training data.” But what does that mean? Remember that limited-memory artificial intelligence is AI that improves over time by being trained with new data. Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that uses algorithms to train data to obtain results.

In broad strokes, three kinds of learnings models are often used in machine learning:

Supervised learning is a machine learning model that maps a specific input to an output using labeled training data (structured data). In simple terms, to train the algorithm to recognize pictures of cats, feed it pictures labeled as cats.

Unsupervised learning is a machine learning model that learns patterns based on unlabeled data (unstructured data). Unlike supervised learning, the end result is not known ahead of time. Rather, the algorithm learns from the data, categorizing it into groups based on attributes. For instance, unsupervised learning is good at pattern matching and descriptive modeling. 

In addition to supervised and unsupervised learning, a mixed approach called semi-supervised learning is often employed, where only some of the data is labeled. In semi-supervised learning, an end result is known, but the algorithm must figure out how to organize and structure the data to achieve the desired results.

Reinforcement learning is a machine learning model that can be broadly described as “learn by doing.” An “agent” learns to perform a defined task by trial and error (a feedback loop) until its performance is within a desirable range. The agent receives positive reinforcement when it performs the task well and negative reinforcement when it performs poorly. An example of reinforcement learning would be teaching a robotic hand to pick up a ball. ",technical,,Artificial Intelligence
"Common types of artificial neural networks
A common type of training model in AI is an artificial neural network, a model loosely based on the human brain. 

A neural network is a system of artificial neurons—sometimes called perceptrons—that are computational nodes used to classify and analyze data. The data is fed into the first layer of a neural network, with each perceptron making a decision, then passing that information onto multiple nodes in the next layer. Training models with more than three layers are referred to as “deep neural networks” or “deep learning.” Some modern neural networks have hundreds or thousands of layers. The output of the final perceptrons accomplish the task set to the neural network, such as classify an object or find patterns in data. 

Some of the most common types of artificial neural networks you may encounter include:

Feedforward neural networks (FF) are one of the oldest forms of neural networks, with data flowing one way through layers of artificial neurons until the output is achieved. In modern days, most feedforward neural networks are considered “deep feedforward” with several layers (and more than one “hidden” layer). Feedforward neural networks are typically paired with an error-correction algorithm called “backpropagation” that, in simple terms, starts with the result of the neural network and works back through to the beginning, finding errors to improve the accuracy of the neural network. Many simple but powerful neural networks are deep feedforward.

Recurrent neural networks (RNN) differ from feedforward neural networks in that they typically use time series data or data that involves sequences. Unlike feedforward neural networks, which use weights in each node of the network, recurrent neural networks have “memory” of what happened in the previous layer as contingent to the output of the current layer. For instance, when performing natural language processing, RNNs can “keep in mind” other words used in a sentence. RNNs are often used for speech recognition, translation, and to caption images. 

Long/short term memory (LSTM) is an advanced form of RNN that can use memory to “remember” what happened in previous layers. The difference between RNNs and LSTM is that LSTM can remember what happened several layers ago, through the use of “memory cells.” LSTM is often used in speech recognition and making predictions. 

Convolutional neural networks (CNN) include some of the most common neural networks in modern artificial intelligence. Most often used in image recognition, CNNs use several distinct layers (a convolutional layer, then a pooling layer) that filter different parts of an image before putting it back together (in the fully connected layer). The earlier convolutional layers may look for simple features of an image, such as colors and edges, before looking for more complex features in additional layers.

Generative adversarial networks (GAN) involve two neural networks competing against each other in a game that ultimately improves the accuracy of the output. One network (the generator) creates examples that the other network (the discriminator) attempts to prove true or false. GANs have been used to create realistic images and even make art.",technical,,Artificial Intelligence
"Benefits of AI
Automation

AI can automate workflows and processes or work independently and autonomously from a human team. For example, AI can help automate aspects of cybersecurity by continuously monitoring and analyzing network traffic. Similarly, a smart factory may have dozens of different kinds of AI in use, such as robots using computer vision to navigate the factory floor or to inspect products for defects, create digital twins, or use real-time analytics to measure efficiency and output.

Reduce human error

AI can eliminate manual errors in data processing, analytics, assembly in manufacturing, and other tasks through automation and algorithms that follow the same processes every single time.

Eliminate repetitive tasks

AI can be used to perform repetitive tasks, freeing human capital to work on higher impact problems. AI can be used to automate processes, like verifying documents, transcribing phone calls, or answering simple customer questions like “what time do you close?” Robots are often used to perform “dull, dirty, or dangerous” tasks in the place of a human. 

Fast and accurate

AI can process more information more quickly than a human, finding patterns and discovering relationships in data that a human may miss.

Infinite availability

AI is not limited by time of day, the need for breaks, or other human encumbrances. When running in the cloud, AI and machine learning can be “always on,” continuously working on its assigned tasks. 

Accelerated research and development 

The ability to analyze vast amounts of data quickly can lead to accelerated breakthroughs in research and development. For instance, AI has been used in predictive modeling of potential new pharmaceutical treatments, or to quantify the human genome. ",technical,,Artificial Intelligence
"Artificial Intelligence History
The term artificial intelligence was coined in 1956, but AI has become more popular today thanks to increased data volumes, advanced algorithms, and improvements in computing power and storage.

Early AI research in the 1950s explored topics like problem solving and symbolic methods. In the 1960s, the US Department of Defense took interest in this type of work and began training computers to mimic basic human reasoning. For example, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) completed street mapping projects in the 1970s. And DARPA produced intelligent personal assistants in 2003, long before Siri, Alexa or Cortana were household names.

This early work paved the way for the automation and formal reasoning that we see in computers today, including decision support systems and smart search systems that can be designed to complement and augment human abilities.

While Hollywood movies and science fiction novels depict AI as human-like robots that take over the world, the current evolution of AI technologies isn’t that scary – or quite that smart. Instead, AI has evolved to provide many specific benefits in every industry. Keep reading for modern examples of artificial intelligence in health care, retail and more.

Today's generative AI technologies have made the benefits of AI clear to a growing number of professionals. LLM-powered AI assistants are showing up inside many existing software products, from forecasting tools to marketing stacks.

The fast adoption of GenAI has also raised questions and concerns about AI anxiety, AI hallucinations, AI governance and AI ethics. As a result, trustworthy AI and responsible AI discussions are becoming crucial in every industry.",technical,,Artificial Intelligence
"Why is artificial intelligence important?
artificial intelligence icon

AI automates repetitive learning and discovery through data. Instead of automating manual tasks, AI performs frequent, high-volume, computerized tasks. And it does so reliably and without fatigue. Of course, humans are still essential to set up the system and ask the right questions.

AI adds intelligence to existing products. Many products you already use will be improved with AI capabilities, much like Siri was added as a feature to a new generation of Apple products. Automation, conversational platforms, bots and smart machines can be combined with large amounts of data to improve many technologies. Upgrades at home and in the workplace, range from security intelligence and smart cams to investment analysis.

AI adapts through progressive learning algorithms to let the data do the programming. AI finds structure and regularities in data so that algorithms can acquire skills. Just as an algorithm can teach itself to play chess, it can teach itself what product to recommend next online. And the models adapt when given new data. 

AI analyzes more and deeper data using neural networks that have many hidden layers. Building a fraud detection system with five hidden layers used to be impossible. All that has changed with incredible computer power and big data. You need lots of data to train deep learning models because they learn directly from the data. 

AI achieves incredible accuracy through deep neural networks. For example, your interactions with Alexa and Google are all based on deep learning. And these products keep getting more accurate the more you use them. In the medical field, AI techniques from deep learning and object recognition can now be used to pinpoint cancer on medical images with improved accuracy.

AI gets the most out of data. When algorithms are self-learning, the data itself is an asset. The answers are in the data – you just have to apply AI to find them. With this tight relationship between data and AI, your data becomes more important than ever. If you have the best data in a competitive industry, even if everyone is applying similar techniques, the best data will win. But using that data to innovate responsibly requires trustworthy AI. And that means your AI systems should be ethical, equitable and sustainable.",technical,,Artificial Intelligence

"What is AI ethics?
AI ethics refers to the principles that govern AI’s behavior in terms of human values. AI ethics helps ensure that AI is developed and used in ways that are beneficial to society. It encompasses a broad range of considerations, including fairness, transparency, accountability, privacy, security, and the potential societal impacts",technical,,Artificial Intelligence
"AI ethics terms and definitions
As an intersection of ethics and high technology, conversations about ethical AI often use vocabulary from both fields. Understanding this vocabulary is important for being able to discuss the ethics of AI:

AI: The ability of a machine to perform cognitive functions we associate with human minds, such as perceiving, reasoning, learning, and problem solving. There are two main types of AI systems, and some systems are a combination of both:

Rule-based AI, also called expert AI, behaves according to a set of fully defined rules created by human experts—as an example, many e-commerce platforms use rule-based AI to provide product recommendations
Learning-based AI solves problems and adapts its functionality on its own, based on its initial human-designed configuration and training dataset—generative AI tools are examples of learning-based AI
AI ethics: A set of values, principles, and techniques that employ widely accepted standards of right and wrong to guide moral conduct in the development, deployment, use, and sale of AI technologies.

AI model: A mathematical framework created by people and trained on data that enables AI systems to perform certain tasks by identifying patterns, making decisions, and predicting outcomes. Common uses include image recognition and language translation, among many others.

AI system: A complex structure of algorithms and models designed to mimic human reasoning and perform tasks autonomously.

Agency: The capacity of individuals to act independently and to make free choices.

Bias: An inclination or prejudice for or against a person or group, especially in a way considered to be unfair. Biases in training data—such as the under- or over-representation of data pertaining to a certain group—can cause AI to act in biased ways.

Explainability: The ability to answer the question, “What did the machine do to reach its output?” Explainability refers to the technological context of the AI system, such as its mechanics, rules and algorithms, and training data.

Fairness: Impartial and just treatment or behavior without unjust favoritism or discrimination.

Human-in-the-loop: The ability of human beings to intervene in every decision cycle of an AI system.

Interpretability: The ability for people to understand the real-life context and impact of an AI system’s output, such as when AI is used to help make a decision about approving or rejecting a loan application.

Large language model (LLM): A type of machine learning often used in text recognition and generation tasks.

Machine learning: A subset of AI that provides systems the ability to automatically learn, improve from experience, and adapt to new data without being explicitly programmed to do so.

Normative: A key context of practical ethics concerned with what people and institutions “should” or “ought” to do in particular situations.

Transparency: Related to explainability, transparency is the ability to justify how and why an AI system is developed, implemented, and used, and to make that information visible and understandable to people.",technical,,Artificial Intelligence

"What is Big Data?
Big data refers to extremely large and diverse collections of structured, unstructured, and semi-structured data that continues to grow exponentially over time. These datasets are so huge and complex in volume, velocity, and variety, that traditional data management systems cannot store, process, and analyze them. 

The amount and availability of data is growing rapidly, spurred on by digital technology advancements, such as connectivity, mobility, the Internet of Things (IoT), and artificial intelligence (AI). As data continues to expand and proliferate, new big data tools are emerging to help companies collect, process, and analyze data at the speed needed to gain the most value from it. 

Big data describes large and diverse datasets that are huge in volume and also rapidly grow in size over time. Big data is used in machine learning, predictive modeling, and other advanced analytics to solve business problems and make informed decisions.

These are just a few ways organizations are using big data to become more data-driven so they can adapt better to the needs and expectations of their customers and the world around them. ",technical,,Artificial Intelligence
"How are data-driven businesses performing?
Some organizations remain wary of going all in on big data because of the time, effort, and commitment it requires to leverage it successfully. In particular, businesses struggle to rework established processes and facilitate the cultural change needed to put data at the heart of every decision.  

But becoming a data-driven business is worth the work. Recent research shows: 

58% of companies that make data-based decisions are more likely to beat revenue targets than those that don't
Organizations with advanced insights-driven business capabilities are 2.8x more likely to report double-digit year-over-year growth
 Data-driven organizations generate, on average, more than 30% growth per year
The enterprises that take steps now and make significant progress toward implementing big data stand to come as winners in the future. ",technical,,Artificial Intelligence
"What is big data analytics?
Big data analytics refers to the systematic processing and analysis of large amounts of data and complex data sets, known as big data, to extract valuable insights. Big data analytics allows for the uncovering of trends, patterns and correlations in large amounts of raw data to help analysts make data-informed decisions. This process allows organizations to leverage the exponentially growing data generated from diverse sources, including internet-of-things (IoT) sensors, social media, financial transactions and smart devices to derive actionable intelligence through advanced analytic techniques.

In the early 2000s, advances in software and hardware capabilities made it possible for organizations to collect and handle large amounts of unstructured data. With this explosion of useful data, open-source communities developed big data frameworks to store and process this data. These frameworks are used for distributed storage and processing of large data sets across a network of computers. Along with additional tools and libraries, big data frameworks can be used for:

Predictive modeling by incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) and statistical algorithms
Statistical analysis for in-depth data exploration and to uncover hidden patterns
What-if analysis to simulate different scenarios and explore potential outcomes
Processing diverse data sets, including structured, semi-structured and unstructured data from various sources.
Four main data analysis methods – descriptive, diagnostic, predictive and prescriptive – are used to uncover insights and patterns within an organization's data. These methods facilitate a deeper understanding of market trends, customer preferences and other important business metrics.",technical,,Artificial Intelligence
"Differences between big data and traditional data
The main difference between big data analytics and traditional data analytics is the type of data handled and the tools used to analyze it. Traditional analytics deals with structured data, typically stored in relational databases. This type of database helps ensure that data is well-organized and easy for a computer to understand. Traditional data analytics relies on statistical methods and tools like structured query language (SQL) for querying databases.

Big data analytics involves massive amounts of data in various formats, including structured, semi-structured and unstructured data. The complexity of this data requires more sophisticated analysis techniques. Big data analytics employs advanced techniques like machine learning and data mining to extract information from complex data sets. It often requires distributed processing systems like Hadoop to manage the sheer volume of data.",technical,,Artificial Intelligence
"Structured Data
Structured data refers to highly organized information that is easily searchable and typically stored in relational databases or spreadsheets. It adheres to a rigid schema, meaning each data element is clearly defined and accessible in a fixed field within a record or file. Examples of structured data include:

Customer names and addresses in a customer relationship management (CRM) system
Transactional data in financial records, such as sales figures and account balances
Employee data in human resources databases, including job titles and salaries
Structured data's main advantage is its simplicity for entry, search and analysis, often using straightforward database queries like SQL. However, the rapidly expanding universe of big data means that structured data represents a relatively small portion of the total data available to organizations.

Unstructured Data
Unstructured data lacks a pre-defined data model, making it more difficult to collect, process and analyze. It comprises the majority of data generated today, and includes formats such as:

Textual content from documents, emails and social media posts
Multimedia content, including images, audio files and videos
Data from IoT devices, which can include a mix of sensor data, log files and time-series data
The primary challenge with unstructured data is its complexity and lack of uniformity, requiring more sophisticated methods for indexing, searching and analyzing. NLP, machine learning and advanced analytics platforms are often employed to extract meaningful insights from unstructured data.

Semi-structured data
Semi-structured data occupies the middle ground between structured and unstructured data. While it does not reside in a relational database, it contains tags or other markers to separate semantic elements and enforce hierarchies of records and fields within the data. Examples include:

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) and XML (eXtensible Markup Language) files, which are commonly used for web data interchange
Email, where the data has a standardized format (e.g., headers, subject, body) but the content within each section is unstructured
NoSQL databases, can store and manage semi-structured data more efficiently than traditional relational databases
Semi-structured data is more flexible than structured data but easier to analyze than unstructured data, providing a balance that is particularly useful in web applications and data integration tasks.",technical,,Artificial Intelligence
"The benefits of using big data analytics
Ensuring data quality and integrity, integrating disparate data sources, protecting data privacy and security and finding the right talent to analyze and interpret data can present challenges to organizations looking to leverage their extensive data volumes. What follows are the benefits organizations can realize once they see success with big data analytics:

Real-time intelligence
One of the standout advantages of big data analytics is the capacity to provide real-time intelligence. Organizations can analyze vast amounts of data as it is generated from myriad sources and in various formats. Real-time insight allows businesses to make quick decisions, respond to market changes instantaneously and identify and act on opportunities as they arise.

Better-informed decisions
With big data analytics, organizations can uncover previously hidden trends, patterns and correlations. A deeper understanding equips leaders and decision-makers with the information needed to strategize effectively, enhancing business decision-making in supply chain management, e-commerce, operations and overall strategic direction.

Cost savings
Big data analytics drives cost savings by identifying business process efficiencies and optimizations. Organizations can pinpoint wasteful expenditures by analyzing large datasets, streamlining operations and enhancing productivity. Moreover, predictive analytics can forecast future trends, allowing companies to allocate resources more efficiently and avoid costly missteps.

Better customer engagement
Understanding customer needs, behaviors and sentiments is crucial for successful engagement and big data analytics provides the tools to achieve this understanding. Companies gain insights into consumer preferences and tailor their marketing strategies by analyzing customer data.

Optimized risk management strategies
Big data analytics enhances an organization's ability to manage risk by providing the tools to identify, assess and address threats in real time. Predictive analytics can foresee potential dangers before they materialize, allowing companies to devise preemptive strategies.",technical,,Artificial Intelligence
"Understanding ML Engineering
A machine learning engineer (ML engineer) is a programmer who designs and builds software that can automate artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) models.

ML engineers build large-scale systems that take in massive data sets and use them to train algorithms that can learn cognitive tasks and generate useful insights and predictions. These systems are then deployed to production where they can serve real users - this is known as the inference stage.

Machine learning engineers manage the entire data science pipeline, including sourcing and preparing data, building and training models, and deploying models to production.

ML engineers typically work within a data science team, collaborating with data scientists, data analysts, IT experts, DevOps experts, software developers, and data engineers.

"What is a data pipeline?
A data pipeline is a method in which raw data is ingested from various data sources, transformed and then ported to a data store, such as a data lake or data warehouse, for analysis.

Before data flows into a data repository, it usually undergoes some data processing. This is inclusive of data transformations, such as filtering, masking, and aggregations, which ensure appropriate data integration and standardization. This is particularly important when the destination for the dataset is a relational database. This type of data repository has a defined schema which requires alignment—that is, matching data columns and types—to update existing data with new data.

As the name suggests, data pipelines act as the “piping” for data science projects or business intelligence dashboards. Data can be sourced through a wide variety of places—APIs, SQL and NoSQL databases, files, et cetera—but unfortunately, that data usually isn’t ready for immediate use. During sourcing, data lineage is tracked to document the relationship between enterprise data in various business and IT applications, for example, where data is currently and how it’s stored in an environment, such as on-premises, in a data lake or in a data warehouse.

Data preparation tasks usually fall on the shoulders of data scientists or data engineers, who structure the data to meet the needs of the business use cases and handle huge amounts of data. The type of data processing that a data pipeline requires is usually determined through a mix of exploratory data analysis and defined business requirements. Once the data has been appropriately filtered, merged, and summarized, it can then be stored and surfaced for use. Well-organized data pipelines provide the foundation for a range of data projects; this can include exploratory data analyses, data visualizations, and machine learning tasks.",technical,,Artificial Intelligence
"Types of data pipelines
There are several main types of data pipelines, each appropriate for specific tasks on specific platforms.

Batch processing
The development of batch processing was a critical step in building data infrastructures that were reliable and scalable. In 2004, MapReduce, a batch processing algorithm, was patented and then subsequently integrated into open-source systems, such as Hadoop, CouchDB and MongoDB.

As the name implies, batch processing loads “batches” of data into a repository during set time intervals, which are typically scheduled during off-peak business hours. This way, other workloads aren’t impacted as batch processing jobs tend to work with large volumes of data, which can tax the overall system. Batch processing is usually the optimal data pipeline when there isn’t an immediate need to analyze a specific dataset (for example, monthly accounting), and it is more associated with the ETL data integration process, which stands for “extract, transform, and load.”

Batch processing jobs form a workflow of sequenced commands, where the output of one command becomes the input of the next command. For example, one command might kick off data ingestion, the next command may trigger filtering of specific columns, and the subsequent command may handle aggregation. This series of commands will continue until the data quality is completely transformed and rewritten into a data repository.",technical,,Artificial Intelligence
"Streaming data
Unlike batching processing, streaming data pipelines—also known as event-driven architectures—continuously process events generated by various sources, such as sensors or user interactions within an application. Events are processed and analyzed, and then either stored in databases or sent downstream for further analysis.

Streaming data is leveraged when it is required for data to be continuously updated. For example, apps or point-of-sale systems need real-time data to update inventory and sales history of their products; that way, sellers can inform consumers if a product is in stock or not. A single action, such as a product sale, is considered an “event,” and related events, such as adding an item to checkout, are typically grouped together as a “topic” or “stream.” These events are then transported via messaging systems or message brokers, such as the open-source offering, Apache Kafka.

Since data events are processed shortly after occurring, streaming processing systems have lower latency than batch systems, but aren’t considered as reliable as batch processing systems as messages can be unintentionally dropped or spend a long time in queue. Message brokers help to address this concern through acknowledgements, where a consumer confirms processing of the message to the broker to remove it from the queue.

Data integration pipelines
Data integration pipelines concentrate on merging data from multiple sources into a single unified view. These pipelines often involve extract, transform and load (ETL) processes that clean, enrich, or otherwise modify raw data before storing it in a centralized repository such as a data warehouse or data lake. Data integration pipelines are essential for handling disparate systems that generate incompatible formats or structures. For example, a connection can be added to Amazon S3 (Amazon Simple Storage Service)—a service that is offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that provides object storage through a web service interface.

Cloud-native data pipelines
A modern data platform includes a suite of cloud-first, cloud-native software products that enable the collection, cleansing, transformation and analysis of an organization’s data to help improve decision making. Today’s data pipelines have become increasingly complex and important for data analytics and making data-driven decisions. A modern data platform builds trust in this data by ingesting, storing, processing and transforming it in a way that ensures accurate and timely information, reduces data silos, enables self-service and improves data quality.",technical,,Artificial Intelligence
"Data pipeline architecture
Three core steps make up the architecture of a data pipeline. 

1. Data ingestion: Data is collected from various sources—including software-as-a-service (SaaS) platforms, internet-of-things (IoT) devices and mobile devices—and various data structures, both structured and unstructured data. Within streaming data, these raw data sources are typically known as producers, publishers, or senders. While businesses can choose to extract data only when ready to process it, it’s a better practice to land the raw data within a cloud data warehouse provider first. This way, the business can update any historical data if they need to make adjustments to data processing jobs. During this data ingestion process, various validations and checks can be performed to ensure the consistency and accuracy of data.

2. Data transformation: During this step, a series of jobs are executed to process data into the format required by the destination data repository. These jobs embed automation and governance for repetitive workstreams, such as business reporting, ensuring that data is cleansed and transformed consistently. For example, a data stream may come in a nested JSON format, and the data transformation stage will aim to unroll that JSON to extract the key fields for analysis.

3. Data storage: The transformed data is then stored within a data repository, where it can be exposed to various stakeholders. Within streaming data, this transformed data are typically known as consumers, subscribers, or recipients.",technical,,Artificial Intelligence
"Data pipeline vs. ETL pipeline
You might find that some terms, such as data pipeline and ETL pipeline, are used interchangeably in conversation. However, you should think about an ETL pipeline as a subcategory of data pipelines. The two types of pipelines are distinguished by three key features:

ETL pipelines follow a specific sequence. As the abbreviation implies, they extract data, transform data, and then load and store data in a data repository. Not all data pipelines need to follow this sequence. In fact, ELT (extract, load, transform) pipelines have become more popular with the advent of cloud-native tools where data can be generated and stored across multiple sources and platforms. While data ingestion still occurs first with this type of pipeline, any transformations are applied after the data has been loaded into the cloud-based data warehouse.

ETL pipelines also tend to imply the use of batch processing, but as noted above, the scope of data pipelines is broader. They can also be inclusive of stream processing.

Finally, while unlikely, data pipelines as a whole do not necessarily need to undergo data transformations, as with ETL pipelines. It’s rare to see a data pipeline that doesn’t utilize transformations to facilitate data analysis.",technical,,Artificial Intelligence
"Use cases of data pipelines
As big data continues to grow, data management becomes an ever-increasing priority. While data pipelines serve various functions, the following are for business applications:

Exploratory data analysis: Data scientists use exploratory data analysis (EDA) to analyze and investigate data sets and summarize their main characteristics, often employing data visualization methods. It helps determine how best to manipulate data sources to get the needed answers, making it easier for data scientists to discover patterns, spot anomalies, test a hypothesis or check assumptions.

Data visualizations: To represent data via common graphics, data visualizations such as charts, plots, infographics, and even animations can be created. These visual displays of information communicate complex data relationships and data-driven insights in a way that is easy to understand.

Machine learning: A branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science, machine learning focuses on the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy. Through the use of statistical methods, algorithms are trained to make classifications or predictions, uncovering key insights within data mining projects.

Data observability: To verify the accuracy and safety of the data being used, data observability applies a variety of tools for monitoring, tracking and alerting for both expected events and anomalies.",technical,,Artificial Intelligence
hat is an ML pipeline?

"AI and Data Pipelines
Another quintessential function of data pipelines is for integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into organizational processes, enabling the seamless flow of data that powers AI-driven insights. Because AI models require vast amounts of data to learn, adapt, and make predictions, the efficiency and robustness of data pipelines directly impact the quality of your organization’s AI outcomes. 

A well-designed data pipeline ensures that data is not only transferred from source to destination but also properly cleaned, enriched, and transformed to meet the specific needs of AI algorithms.",technical,,Artificial Intelligence

The method of collecting data from a population, regarding a sample on a group of items and examining it to draw out some conclusion, is known as Sample Method. This method is even used in the day-to-day lives of people. For example, a cook takes a spoon of pulses to check whether the whole pulse is evenly cooked. The sampling method of collecting data is suitable for a large population and when the investigator does not require a high level of accuracy. It is also preferred by investigators when they do not need an intensive examination of items. ",technical,,Artificial Intelligence

"Traditional vs. cloud-based data warehouse
Traditional data warehouses are hosted on-premises, with data flowing in from relational databases, transactional systems, business applications, and other source systems. However, they are typically designed to capture a subset of data in batches and store it based on rigid schemas, making them unsuitable for spontaneous queries or real-time analysis. Companies also must purchase their own hardware and software with an on-premises data warehouse, making it expensive to scale and maintain. In a traditional warehouse, storage is typically limited compared to compute, so data is transformed quickly and then discarded to keep storage space free.

Today’s data analytics activities have transformed to the center of all core business activities, including revenue generation, cost containment, improving operations, and enhancing customer experiences. As data evolves and diversifies, organizations need more robust data warehouse solutions and advanced analytic tools for storing, managing, and analyzing large quantities of data across their organizations. 

These systems must be scalable, reliable, secure enough for regulated industries, and flexible enough to support a wide variety of data types and big data use cases. They also need to support flexible pricing and compute, so you only pay for what you need instead of guessing your capacity. The requirements go beyond the capabilities of most legacy data warehouses. As a result, many enterprises are turning to cloud-based data warehouse solutions.

A cloud data warehouse makes no trade-offs from a traditional data warehouse, but extends capabilities and runs on a fully managed service in the cloud. Cloud data warehousing offers instant scalability to meet changing business requirements and powerful data processing to support complex analytical queries. 

With a cloud data warehouse, you benefit from the inherent flexibility of a cloud environment with more predictable costs. The up-front investment is typically much lower and lead times are shorter with on-premises data warehouse solutions because the cloud service provider manages and maintains the physical infrastructure.

"What is a Data Warehouse?
A data warehouse, also called an enterprise data warehouse (EDW), is an enterprise data platform used for the analysis and reporting of structured and semi-structured data from multiple data sources, such as point-of-sale transactions, marketing automation, customer relationship management, and more. 

Data warehouses include an analytical database and critical analytical components and procedures. They support ad hoc analysis and custom reporting, such as data pipelines, queries, and business applications. They can consolidate and integrate massive amounts of current and historical data in one place and are designed to give a long-range view of data over time. These data warehouse capabilities have made data warehousing a primary staple of enterprise analytics that help support informed business decisions.

"Modern data architecture
As organizations build their roadmaps for tomorrow’s applications, including AI, blockchain and Internet of Things (IoT) workloads, they need a modern data architecture that can support the data requirements.

The top characteristics of a modern data architecture are:

Cloud-native and cloud-enabled so that the data architecture can benefit from the elastic scaling and high availability of the cloud.

Robust, scalable and portable data pipelines, which combine intelligent workflows, cognitive analytics and real-time integration in a single framework.

Seamless data integration, using standard API interfaces to connect to legacy applications.

Real-time data enablement, including validation, classification, management and governance.

Decoupled and extensible, so there are no dependencies between services, and open standards enable interoperability.

"Benefits of data architectures
Well-constructed data architecture can offer businesses several key benefits, which include:

Reducing redundancy
Improving data quality
Enabling integration
Data lifecycle management
Reducing redundancy
There might be overlapping data fields across different sources, resulting in the risk of inconsistency, data inaccuracies and missed opportunities for data integration. A good data architecture can standardize how data is stored and potentially reduce duplication, enabling better quality and holistic analyses.

Improving data quality
Well-designed data architectures can solve some of the challenges of poorly managed data lakes, also known as “data swamps”. A data swamp lacks appropriate data standards, including data quality and data governance practices, to provide insightful lessons.

Data architectures can help enforce data governance and data security standards, enabling the appropriate oversight of data pipelines. By improving data quality and governance, data architectures can help ensure that data is stored in a way that makes it useful now and in the future.

Enabling integration
Data is often siloed as a result of technical limitations on data storage and organizational barriers within the enterprise. Today’s data architectures aim to facilitate data integration across domains so that different geographies and business functions have access to each other’s data. That leads to a better and more consistent understanding of common metrics, such as expenses, revenue and their associated drivers. It also enables a more holistic view of customers, products and geographies to inform data-driven decision-making.

Data lifecycle management
A modern data architecture can address how data is managed over time. Data typically becomes less useful as it ages and is accessed less frequently. Over time, data can be migrated to cheaper, slower storage types so it remains available for reports and audits, but without the expense of high-performance storage.",technical,,Artificial Intelligence
"Types of data architectures
Data fabrics
A data fabric is an architecture that focuses on the automation of data integration, data engineering and governance in a data value chain between data providers and data consumers.

A data fabric is based on the notion of “active metadata” that uses data catalogs, knowledge graphs, semantics, data mining and machine learning technology to discover patterns in various types of metadata (for example, system logs, social and more). Then, it applies this insight to automate and orchestrate the data value chain.

For example, a data fabric can enable a data consumer to find a data product and then have that data product provisioned to them automatically. The increased data access between data products and data consumers leads to a reduction in data siloes and provides a more complete picture of the organization’s data.

Data fabrics are an emerging technology with enormous potential. They can be used to enhance customer profiling, fraud detection and preventive maintenance. According to Gartner, data fabrics reduce integration design time by 30%, deployment time by 30% and maintenance by 70%.

Data meshes
A data mesh is a decentralized data architecture that organizes data by business domain.

Using a data mesh, the organization needs to stop thinking of data as a by-product of a process and start thinking of it as a product in its own right. Data producers act as data product owners. As subject matter experts, data producers can use their understanding of the data’s primary consumers to design APIs for them. These APIs can also be accessed from other parts of the organization, providing broader access to managed data.

More traditional storage systems, such as data lakes and data warehouses, can be used as multiple decentralized data repositories to realize a data mesh. A data mesh can also work with a data fabric, with the data fabric’s automation enabling new data products to be created more quickly or enforcing global governance.",technical,,Artificial Intelligence
"The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF)
This enterprise architecture methodology was developed in 1995 by The Open Group, of which IBM is a Platinum Member.

There are 4 pillars to the architecture:

Business architecture, which defines the enterprise’s organizational structure, data strategy and processes.

Data architecture, which describes the conceptual, logical and physical data assets and how they are stored and managed throughout their lifecycle.

Applications architecture, which represents the application systems and how they relate to key business processes and each other.

Technical architecture, which describes the data infrastructure (hardware, software and networking) needed to support mission-critical applications.
TOGAF provides a complete framework for designing and implementing an enterprise’s IT architecture, including its data architecture.

"Conceptual data models: They are also referred to as ""domain models"" and offer a big-picture view of what the system will contain, how it will be organized and which business rules are involved.

Conceptual models are created as part of the process of gathering initial project requirements. Typically, they include entity classes (defining the types of things that are important for the business to represent in the data model), their characteristics and constraints, the relationships between them and relevant security and data integrity requirements.
Logical data models: They are less abstract and provide greater detail about the concepts and relationships in the domain under consideration. One of several formal data modeling notation systems is followed. These indicate data attributes, such as data types and their corresponding lengths, and show the relationships among entities. Logical data models don’t specify any technical system requirements.
Physical data models: The physical data model is the most detailed and specific of the 3. It defines the actual implementation of the database, including table structures, indexes, storage and performance considerations. It focuses on the technical aspects of how the data will be stored and accessed, and it is used for database schema creation and optimization.",technical,,Artificial Intelligence
"Relational Model in DBMS
Last Updated : 23 Jan, 2025
The Relational Model represents data and their relationships through a collection of tables. Each table also known as a relation consists of rows and columns. Every column has a unique name and corresponds to a specific attribute, while each row contains a set of related data values representing a real-world entity or relationship. This model is part of the record-based models which structure data in fixed-format records each belonging to a particular type with a defined set of attributes.

E.F. Codd introduced the Relational Model to organize data as relations or tables. After creating the conceptual design of a database using an ER diagram, this design must be transformed into a relational model which can then be implemented using relational database systems like Oracle SQL or MySQL.

What is the Relational Model? 
The relational model represents how data is stored in Relational Databases. A relational database consists of a collection of tables each of which is assigned a unique name. Consider a relation STUDENT with attributes ROLL_NO, NAME, ADDRESS, PHONE, and AGE shown in the table",technical,,Artificial Intelligence
"A data architecture describes how data is managed, from collection through to transformation, distribution and consumption. It sets the blueprint for data and the way that it flows through data storage systems. It is foundational to data processing operations and artificial intelligence (AI) applications.

The design of a data architecture should be driven by business requirements and data needs, which data architects and data engineers use to define the respective data model and underlying data structures that support it. These designs typically facilitate a business strategy or business need, such as a reporting or data science initiative.

As new data sources appear from emerging technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), a good data architecture helps ensure that data is manageable and useful, supporting data lifecycle management. More specifically, it can avoid redundant data storage, improve data quality through cleansing and deduplication and enable new applications such as generative AI.

Modern data architectures also provide mechanisms to integrate data across domains, such as between departments or geographies. They break down data silos without the huge complexity that comes with storing everything in one place.

Modern data architectures often use cloud platforms to manage and process data. While it can be more costly, its compute scalability enables important data processing tasks to be completed rapidly. The storage scalability also helps to cope with rising data volumes and ensure that all relevant data is available to improve the quality of training AI applications.",technical,,Artificial Intelligence
"Components of a Database
Databases consist of several critical components that work together to store, organize, and retrieve data effectively. Here’s a detailed explanation of each component:

1. Data
Data is the core component of any database, representing the actual information stored. It can include numbers, text, images, videos, or documents, depending on the database’s purpose. For instance, a customer database might store customer names, addresses, and purchase histories

2. Schema
The schema is the blueprint or structure of the database. It defines how data is organized and includes details like tables, columns, data types, and relationships between entities. For example, a table in a customer database might have columns like CustomerID, Name, and Email. The schema ensures consistency and helps users understand how the database is designed.

3. DBMS
The DBMS is the software layer that enables interaction with the database. It manages the storage, retrieval, and manipulation of data while ensuring security and data integrity. Examples of DBMS software include MySQL, Oracle, and MongoDB. The DBMS also handles tasks like backup, recovery, and query optimization to maintain the database’s performance.

4. Queries
Queries are commands used to interact with the database, allowing users to retrieve, manipulate, or update data. For relational databases, SQL (Structured Query Language) is commonly used. For instance, a query like SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE Country = 'USA'; retrieves all customers from the USA. Queries are vital for extracting actionable insights and managing data effectively.

5. Users
Users are individuals or applications that interact with the database. They can have different levels of access based on their roles, such as administrators, developers, or end-users. For example, a database administrator might have full control, including the ability to create or delete tables, while a regular user might only have permission to view specific data.",technical,,Artificial Intelligence
"What is Database?
Last Updated : 23 Jan, 2025
In today’s data-driven world, databases are indispensable for managing, storing, and retrieving information efficiently. From small-scale businesses to global enterprises, databases serve as the backbone of operations, powering applications, websites, and analytics systems.

In this comprehensive article, we will explain what a database is, explore its types, and discuss how it functions, with examples to help us better understand its significance.

Introduction to Databases
A database is an electronically stored, systematic collection of data that can include words, numbers, images, videos, and other types of files. Databases are managed using specialized software called a Database Management System (DBMS), which allows users to store, retrieve, and manipulate data efficiently. Databases are the backbone of modern applications, supporting businesses, organizations, and systems across industries.

Key Features of a Database
Organized Data Storage: Data is stored in structured formats, such as tables, documents, or key-value pairs.
Efficient Access: Advanced search and query capabilities allow for quick data retrieval.
Security and Scalability: Databases provide robust security measures and can scale with growing data needs.
Why is a Database Important?
Databases play a critical role in managing and organizing data, enabling businesses to operate efficiently and make informed decisions. Here’s why they are essential:

1. Efficient Scaling: Databases can handle massive amounts of data, scaling to millions or billions of records. Without databases, managing this level of digital data would be impossible.

2. Data Integrity: Built-in rules and conditions in databases ensure data consistency and accuracy, even as it grows or changes.

3. Data Security: Databases protect sensitive information by implementing user authentication, access control, and compliance with privacy regulations.

4. Data Analytics: Modern databases support analytics tools to identify patterns, trends, and predictions. This capability helps organizations make data-driven decisions.

"Characteristics of Linear Data Structure:
Sequential Organization: In linear data structures, data elements are arranged sequentially, one after the other. Each element has a unique predecessor (except for the first element) and a unique successor (except for the last element)
Order Preservation: The order in which elements are added to the data structure is preserved. This means that the first element added will be the first one to be accessed or removed, and the last element added will be the last one to be accessed or removed.
Fixed or Dynamic Size: Linear data structures can have either fixed or dynamic sizes. Arrays typically have a fixed size when they are created, while other structures like linked lists, stacks, and queues can dynamically grow or shrink as elements are added or removed.
Efficient Access: Accessing elements within a linear data structure is typically efficient. For example, arrays offer constant-time access to elements using their index.",technical,,Artificial Intelligence

Conclusion
What is the Actor-Critic Algorithm?
The actor-critic algorithm is a type of reinforcement learning algorithm that combines aspects of both policy-based methods (Actor) and value-based methods (Critic). This hybrid approach is designed to address the limitations of each method when used individually.

In the actor-critic framework, an agent (the ""actor"") learns a policy to make decisions, and a value function (the ""Critic"") evaluates the actions taken by the Actor.

Simultaneously, the critic evaluates these actions by estimating their value or quality. This dual role allows the method to strike a balance between exploration and exploitation, leveraging the strengths of both policy and value functions.

Key Components of Reinforcement Learning
Before delving into the actor-critic method, it's crucial to understand the fundamental components of reinforcement learning (RL):

Agent: The entity making decisions and interacting with the environment.
Environment: The external system with which the agent interacts.
State: A representation of the current situation or configuration.
Action: The decision or move made by the agent.
Reward: The feedback received by the agent based on its actions.
Policy: The strategy or set of rules guiding the agent's decision-making.
Roles of Actor and Critic
Actor: The actor makes decisions by selecting actions based on the current policy. Its responsibility lies in exploring the action space to maximize expected cumulative rewards. By continuously refining the policy, the actor adapts to the dynamic nature of the environment.
Critic: The critic evaluates the actions taken by the actor. It estimates the value or quality of these actions by providing feedback on their performance. The critic's role is pivotal in guiding the actor towards actions that lead to higher expected returns, contributing to the overall improvement of the learning process.
Key Terms in Actor Critic Algorithm
There are two key terms:

Policy (Actor) :
The policy, denoted as 
π
(
a
∣
s
)
π(a∣s), represents the probability of taking action a in state s.
The actor seeks to maximize the expected return by optimizing this policy.
The policy is modeled by the actor network, and its parameters are denoted by 
θ
θ
Value Function (Critic) :
The value function, denoted as 
V
(
s
)
V(s), estimates the expected cumulative reward starting from state s.
The value function is modeled by the critic network, and its parameters are denoted by w.
How Actor-Critic Algorithm works?
Actor Critic Algorithm Objective Function
The objective function for the Actor-Critic algorithm is a combination of the policy gradient (for the actor) and the value function (for the critic).
The overall objective function is typically expressed as the sum of two components:

The advantage function, then, provides a measure of how much better or worse an action is compared to the average action.

These mathematical expressions highlight the essential computations involved in the Actor-Critic method. The actor is updated based on the policy gradient, encouraging actions with higher advantages, while the critic is updated to minimize the difference between the estimated value and the action-value.

A2C (Advantage Actor-Critic)
A2C (Advantage Actor-Critic) is a specific variant of the Actor-Critic algorithm that introduces the concept of the advantage function. This function measures how much better an action is compared to the average action in a given state. By incorporating this advantage information, A2C focuses the learning process on actions that have a significantly higher value than the typical action taken in that state.

While both leverage the actor-critic architecture, here's a key distinction between them:

Learning from the Average: The base Actor-Critic method uses the difference between the actual reward and the estimated value (critic's evaluation) to update the actor.
Learning from the Advantage: A2C leverages the advantage function, incorporating the difference between the action's value and the average value of actions in that state. This additional information refines the learning process further.

Initialization:

Implementation of REINFORCE Algorithm
Basics of Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement Learning is a machine learning algorithm that trains the agent by rewarding on good actions and punishing them for bad actions.

Important Terms of Reinforcement Learning
Let's assume, that we are teaching a robot to play a game then the robot is our agent. The environment is the game world that includes characters, obstacles and everything the robot interacts with. The actions are the moves or decisions the robot can make, like going left or right. In the game, getting points or losing points is the reward based on the action of the agent.

Policy Gradient
The policy gradient method focusses on learning a policy - a strategy or set of rules guiding an agent's decision-making process. The policy gradient method is represented by a parameterized function, such as neural network. The function takes the state of environment as input and provide output as probability distribution over the possible actions.

Monte Carlo Methods
The expected reward is estimated using Monte Carlo methods to estimate the expected reward. The method involves sampling sequences of actions, states, and rewards and use them to update the policy.

What is REINFORCE Algorithm?
REINFORCE algorithm was introduced by Ronald J. Williams in 1992. The aim of the algorithm was to maximize the expected cumulative reward by adjusting the policy parameters. The REINFORCE Algorithm is used to train agents to make sequential decision in an environment. It is a policy gradient method that belongs to the family of Monte Carlo algorithms. In REINFORCE, a neural network is employed to present a policy, which is a strategy guiding the agent's action in different states.

The algorithm updates the neural network's parameters based on the obtained rewards, aiming to enhance the likelihood of actions that lead to higher cumulative rewards. This is an iterative process that allows the agent to learn a policy for decision-making in the given environment.

REward Increment = Non-negative Factor × Offset Reinforcement × Characteristic Eligibility

Algorithm
Set up the policy parameters: First, establish an initial policy. A parametric representation or a neural network might be used for this.
Get Paths of Collection: In order to gather a collection of trajectories—sequences of states, actions, and rewards—execute the present policy in the environment.
Determine Returns: Compute the return, or the total of the discounted rewards from each state forward, for each one in the trajectory.
Calculate the Policy Gradient: Determine the gradient of the anticipated return about the parameters of the policy. To do this, one must compute the gradient of the log likelihood of the chosen course of action.
Refresh the policy parameters: The policy parameters should be updated in a way that makes it more likely that the actions will result in greater returns. Gradient ascent is usually used for this.
Repeat: Steps 2 through 5 should be repeated many time",technical,,Artificial Intelligence
"Deep Q-Learning
Last Updated : 23 Jan, 2023
Q-Learning is required as a pre-requisite as it is a process of Q-Learning creates an exact matrix for the working agent which it can “refer to” to maximize its reward in the long run. Although this approach is not wrong in itself, this is only practical for very small environments and quickly loses it’s feasibility when the number of states and actions in the environment increases. The solution for the above problem comes from the realization that the values in the matrix only have relative importance ie the values only have importance with respect to the other values. Thus, this thinking leads us to Deep Q-Learning which uses a deep neural network to approximate the values. This approximation of values does not hurt as long as the relative importance is preserved. The basic working step for Deep Q-Learning is that the initial state is fed into the neural network and it returns the Q-value of all possible actions as an output.

Conclusion
Understanding Bidirectional Search Algorithm
Bidirectional search is an effective search technique used in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) for finding the shortest path between an initial and a goal state. It operates by simultaneously running two separate search processes—one forward from the initial state and the other backward from the goal state. The search stops when the two processes meet in the middle. This method is particularly useful in large search spaces where traditional search techniques like Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) may be inefficient.

How Bidirectional Search Works?
Bidirectional search uses two simultaneous searches to potentially reduce the total search time. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of how it typically works:

Initial Setup: Initialize two searches. One starts from the initial state and expands forward. The other starts from the goal state and expands backward.
Node Expansion: Both searches alternately expand the nearest unexplored node. For each node, all possible successors (in the forward direction) or predecessors (in the backward direction) are generated.
Checking Intersections: After each expansion, check if any of the newly generated nodes are present in the frontier of the opposite search.
Meeting Point: Once a common node is discovered, this node acts as the meeting point, and the optimal path can be constructed by joining the paths from the initial state to the meeting point and from the meeting point to the goal state.",technical,,Artificial Intelligence

Introduction to Iterative Deepening Search
Iterative Deepening Search (IDS) is a search algorithm used in AI that blends the completeness of Breadth-First Search (BFS) with the space efficiency of Depth-First Search (DFS). IDS explores a graph or a tree by progressively increasing the depth limit with each iteration, effectively performing a series of DFS operations until the goal node is found.

"Uniform Cost Search (UCS) in AI
Last Updated : 23 Aug, 2024
Uniform Cost Search (UCS) is a popular search algorithm used in artificial intelligence (AI) for finding the least cost path in a graph. It is a variant of Dijkstra's algorithm and is particularly useful when all edges of the graph have different weights, and the goal is to find the path with the minimum total cost from a start node to a goal node.

In this article, we will explore the fundamentals of UCS, its working mechanism, and its applications in AI.

Introduction to Uniform Cost Search (UCS)
Uniform Cost Search is a pathfinding algorithm that expands the least cost node first, ensuring that the path to the goal node has the minimum cost. Unlike other search algorithms like Breadth-First Search (BFS), UCS takes into account the cost of each path, making it suitable for weighted graphs where each edge has a different cost.

Key Concepts of Uniform Cost Search
Priority Queue: UCS uses a priority queue to store nodes. The node with the lowest cumulative cost is expanded first. This ensures that the search explores the most promising paths first.
Path Cost: The cost associated with reaching a particular node from the start node. UCS calculates the cumulative cost from the start node to the current node and prioritizes nodes with lower costs.
Exploration: UCS explores nodes by expanding the least costly node first, continuing this process until the goal node is reached. The path to the goal node is guaranteed to be the least costly one.
Termination: The algorithm terminates when the goal node is expanded, ensuring that the first time the goal node is reached, the path is the optimal one.",technical,,Artificial Intelligence
"Key characteristics of DFS
In simple terms, the DFS algorithms in AI holds the power of extending the current path as deeply as possible before considering the other options.

DFS is not cost-optimal since it doesn't guarantee to find the shortest paths.
DFS uses the simple principle to keep track of visited nodes: It uses a stack to keep track of nodes that have been visited so far which helps in the backtracking of the graph. When the DFS encounters a new node, it adds it to the stack to explore its neighbours. If it reaches a node with no successors (leaf node), it works by backtracking such as popping nodes off the stack to explore the alternative paths.
Backtracking search: The variant of DFS is called backtracking search which uses less memory than traditional depth-first search. Rather than generating all the successors, the backtracking search enables the DFS to generate only one successor at a time. This approach allows dynamic state modification, such as generating successors by directly modifying the current state description instead of allocating the memory to a brand-new state. Thus reducing the memory requirements to store one state description and path of actions.",technical,,Artificial Intelligence

Last Updated : 13 Dec, 2024
Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become an integral part of modern technology, influencing everything from how we interact with our devices to how businesses operate. However, AI is not a monolithic concept; it can be classified into different types based on its functionalities. Understanding these types is essential for anyone interested in the field of AI, whether you're a developer, a business leader, or simply curious about how AI works.

This article explores the different types of AI based on functionalities, providing insights into their distinct characteristics and applications.

Table of Content

1. Reactive AI
2. Limited Memory AI
3. Theory of Mind AI
4. Self-Aware AI
Types of AI Based on Functionalities
Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be classified based on its functionalities into various types. Here are the main types:

Reactive AI
Limited Memory AI
Theory of Mind AI
Self-Aware AI
Reactive AI: The Foundation of Artificial Intelligence
Reactive AI is the most basic type of AI. It is designed to respond to specific inputs with predetermined outputs and does not have the ability to form memories or learn from past experiences. Reactive AI operates solely on the present data it receives, making decisions based on immediate information.

Key Characteristics of Reactive AI
No Memory: Reactive AI does not store any past data or experiences, so each interaction is treated as a new one.
Task-Specific: It is designed to perform specific tasks and cannot adapt to new situations beyond its programming.
Lacks Understanding of Context: This type of AI does not understand the broader context or the environment in which it operates.
Examples of Reactive AI systems
IBM's Deep Blue
The chess-playing computer that famously defeated world champion Garry Kasparov in 1997 is a classic example of Reactive AI. Deep Blue could evaluate a vast number of possible moves and counter-moves in the game but had no understanding of the game itself beyond the rules and its programming. It could not learn or improve from its experiences.

Google's AlphaGo
AlphaGo, developed by DeepMind, is a reactive AI that famously defeated the world champion Go player, Lee Sedol, in 2016. Like Deep Blue, AlphaGo could evaluate numerous possible moves and counter-moves in the game of Go. However, it lacked any understanding of the game beyond its programming and could not learn or improve from its past experiences during a game.

Limited Memory AI: Learning from the Past
Limited Memory AI builds upon Reactive AI by incorporating the ability to learn from historical data to make better decisions in the future. This type of AI can store past experiences and use them to influence future actions, making it more advanced and adaptable than Reactive AI.

Key Characteristics of Limited Memory AI
Memory-Dependent: Limited Memory AI systems can retain and use past data to improve their decision-making processes.
Training Required: These systems require training on large datasets to function effectively, as they learn patterns from historical data.
Improved Adaptability: Unlike Reactive AI, Limited Memory AI can adapt to new information and scenarios, making it more versatile in dynamic environments.
Example of Limited Memory AI
Self-Driving Cars
Autonomous vehicles are a prominent example of Limited Memory AI. These cars are equipped with sensors and cameras that continuously gather data about the environment. They use this data, along with stored information from previous drives, to make real-time decisions such as when to stop, accelerate, or change lanes. The more data the car collects, the better it becomes at predicting and responding to various driving scenarios.

Theory of Mind AI: Understanding Human Emotions and Beliefs
Theory of Mind AI represents a more advanced type of AI that has the capability to understand and interpret human emotions, beliefs, intentions, and social interactions. This type of AI is still in the research and development phase, but it aims to create machines that can engage in more natural and meaningful interactions with humans.

Key Characteristics of Theory of Mind AI
Social Intelligence: Theory of Mind AI is designed to understand and respond to human emotions and social cues, making interactions more personalized and effective.
Human-Like Understanding: It can anticipate how humans might react in certain situations, leading to more intuitive and responsive AI systems.
Complex Decision-Making: This type of AI can consider multiple variables, including emotional states and social contexts, when making decisions.
Example of Theory of Mind AI
Sophia the Robot
Developed by Hanson Robotics, Sophia is designed to engage in human-like conversations and simulate emotions through facial expressions and body language. Although her responses are scripted and based on pre-defined algorithms, Sophia represents an attempt to create robots that can interact socially and recognize human emotions.

Kismet
Developed at MIT Media Lab, Kismet is an early robot designed to interact with humans in a socially intelligent manner. It can recognize and respond to emotional cues through facial expressions and vocal tones, simulating the ability to understand and respond to human emotions.

Self-Aware AI: The Future of Artificial Intelligence
Self-aware AI represents the most advanced and theoretical type of AI. As the name suggests, self-aware AI systems would possess a level of consciousness similar to that of humans. They would be aware of their own existence, have the ability to form their own beliefs, desires, and emotions, and could potentially surpass human intelligence.

Key Characteristics of Self-Aware AI
Self-Consciousness: These AI systems would have a sense of self, allowing them to understand their own existence and their place in the world.
Autonomous Decision-Making: Self-aware AI would be capable of making decisions based on a deep understanding of itself and its environment.
Ethical Considerations: The development of self-aware AI raises significant ethical questions, including the rights of such entities and the potential risks of creating machines that could surpass human intelligence.
Example of Self-Aware AI
Hypothetical Advanced AI Systems
Future AI systems that could possess self-awareness might be capable of introspection, understanding their own state, and making independent decisions based on self-interest. Such systems are often depicted in science fiction, like HAL 9000 from ""2001: A Space Odyssey.""

Theoretical AI in Research
Researchers in AI ethics and philosophy discuss the potential and implications of self-aware AI. These discussions involve theoretical frameworks for creating AI that understands its existence and possesses consciousness.

AI in Science Fiction
Characters like Skynet from the ""Terminator"" series, the AI in ""Ex Machina,"" and other science fiction portrayals often depict self-aware AI. These fictional examples explore the ethical, philosophical, and practical challenges of creating machines with self-awareness.

Conclusion
The evolution of AI from Reactive AI to the potential future of Self-aware AI highlights the remarkable progress being made in the field. While Reactive AI and Limited Memory AI are already transforming industries, the future holds even more promise with the development of Theory of Mind and Self-aware AI.

"Let’s analyze the use cases and advantages of a convolutional neural network over a simple deep learning network. 

Weight sharing: 
It makes use of Local Spatial coherence that provides same weights to some of the edges, In this way, this weight sharing minimizes the cost of computing. This is especially useful when GPU is low power or missing. 
 



Memory Saving: 
The reduced number of parameters helps in memory saving. For e.g. in case of MNIST dataset to recognize digits, if we use a CNN with single hidden layer and 10 nodes, it would require few hundred nodes but if we use a simple deep neural network, it would require around 19000 parameters. 

Independent of local variations in Image: 
Let’s consider if we are training our fully connected neural network for face recognition with head-shot images of people, Now if we test it on an image which is not a head-shot image but full body image then it may fail to recognize. Since the convolutional neural network makes use of convolution operation, they are independent of local variations in the image. 

Equivariance: 
Equivariance is the property of CNNs and one that can be seen as a specific type of parameter sharing. Conceptually, a function can be considered equivariance if, upon a change in the input, a similar change is reflected in the output. Mathematically, it can be represented as f(g(x)) = g(f(x)). It turns out that convolutions are equivariant to many data transformation operations which helps us to identify, how a particular change in input will affect the output. This helps us to identify any drastic change in the output and retain the reliability of the model. 

Independent of Transformations: 
CNNs are much more independent to geometrical transformations like Scaling, Rotation etc. ",technical,,Artificial Intelligence
"Types of Hidden Layers in Artificial Neural Networks
1. Dense (Fully Connected) Layer
A dense layer is the most common type of hidden layer in an ANN. Every neuron in a dense layer is connected to every neuron in the previous and subsequent layers. This layer performs a weighted sum of inputs and applies an activation function to introduce non-linearity. The activation function (like ReLU, Sigmoid, or Tanh) helps the network learn complex patterns.

Key Points:

Role: Learns representations from input data.
Function: Performs weighted sum and activation.
Example: Common in fully connected neural networks.
2. Convolutional Layer
Convolutional layers are primarily used in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image processing tasks. They apply convolution operations to the input, capturing spatial hierarchies in the data. Convolutional layers use filters to scan across the input and generate feature maps. This helps in detecting edges, textures, and other visual features.

Key Points:

Role: Extracts spatial features from images.
Function: Applies convolution using filters.
Example: Detects edges and textures in images.
3. Recurrent Layer
Recurrent layers, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), are used in Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for sequence data like time series or natural language. They have connections that loop back, allowing information to persist across time steps. This makes them suitable for tasks where context and temporal dependencies are important.

Key Points:

Role: Processes sequential data with temporal dependencies.
Function: Maintains state across time steps.
Example: Language modeling, time series prediction.
4. Dropout Layer
Dropout layers are a regularization technique used to prevent overfitting. They randomly drop a fraction of the neurons during training, which forces the network to learn more robust features and reduces dependency on specific neurons. During training, each neuron is retained with a probability ppp.

Key Points:

Role: Prevents overfitting.
Function: Randomly drops neurons during training.
Example: Common in deep learning models to improve generalization.
5. Pooling Layer
A Pooling Layer is used to reduce the spatial dimensions of the data, thereby decreasing the computational load and controlling overfitting. Common types of pooling include Max Pooling and Average Pooling.

Use Cases: Dimensionality reduction in CNNs

6. Batch Normalization Layer
A Batch Normalization Layer normalizes the output of a previous activation layer by subtracting the batch mean and dividing by the batch standard deviation. This helps in accelerating the training process and improving the performance of the network.

Use Cases: Stabilizing and speeding up training",technical,,Artificial Intelligence
"Introduction to ANN Layers
In an ANN, data flows from the input layer, through one or more hidden layers, to the output layer. Each layer consists of neurons that receive input, process it, and pass the output to the next layer. The layers work together to extract features, transform data, and make predictions.

An ANN typically consists of three primary types of layers:

Input Layer
Hidden Layers
Output Layer
Each layer is composed of nodes (neurons) that are interconnected. The layers work together to process data through a series of transformations.

The Basic Layers in ANN
1. Input Layer
The input layer is the first layer in an ANN and is responsible for receiving the raw input data. This layer's neurons correspond to the features in the input data. For example, in image processing, each neuron might represent a pixel value. The input layer doesn't perform any computations but passes the data to the next layer.

Key Points:

Role: Receives raw data.
Function: Passes data to the hidden layers.
Example: For an image, the input layer would have neurons for each pixel value.

2. Hidden Layers
Hidden Layers are the intermediate layers between the input and output layers. They perform most of the computations required by the network. Hidden layers can vary in number and size, depending on the complexity of the task.

Each hidden layer applies a set of weights and biases to the input data, followed by an activation function to introduce non-linearity.

3. Output Layer
The Output Layer is the final layer in an ANN. It produces the output predictions. The number of neurons in this layer corresponds to the number of classes in a classification problem or the number of outputs in a regression problem. The activation function used in the output layer depends on the type of problem:

Sigmoid for binary classification
Linear for regression",technical,,Artificial Intelligence
"K-Nearest Neighbors is one of the most basic yet essential classification algorithms in Machine Learning. It belongs to the supervised learning domain and finds intense application in pattern recognition, data mining, and intrusion detection. The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a simple, easy-to-implement supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used to solve both classification and regression problems. The KNN algorithm assumes that similar things exist in close proximity. In other words, similar things are near to each other. KNN captures the idea of similarity (sometimes called distance, proximity, or closeness) with some mathematics we might have learned in our childhood— calculating the distance between points on a graph. There are other ways of calculating distance, which might be preferable depending on the problem we are solving. However, the straight-line distance (also called the Euclidean distance) is a popular and familiar choice. It is widely disposable in real-life scenarios since it is non-parametric, meaning, it does not make any underlying assumptions about the distribution of data (as opposed to other algorithms such as GMM, which assume a Gaussian distribution of the given data). This article illustrates K-nearest neighbors on a sample random data using sklearn library.",technical,,Artificial Intelligence
"Data Processing Process
There are three main data processing methods – manual, mechanical and electronic.

Manual Data Processing
Manual data processing relies on human effort to manage and manipulate data. It involves tasks such as sorting, calculating, and recording information without the use of machines or electronic devices. While it is prone to errors and time-consuming, manual processing remains relevant in situations where human judgment, intuition, or a personal touch is necessary.

Mechanical Data Processing
Mechanical data processing involves the use of machines, like punch cards or mechanical calculators, to handle data. It represents an intermediate stage between manual and electronic processing, offering increased efficiency over manual methods but lacking the speed and sophistication of electronic systems. This method was prominent before the widespread adoption of computers.

Electronic Data Processing
Electronic data processing leverages computers and digital technology to perform data-related tasks. It has revolutionized the field by significantly enhancing processing speed, accuracy, and capacity. Electronic data processing encompasses various techniques, including batch processing, real-time processing, and online processing, making it a cornerstone of modern information management and analysis.",technical,,Artificial Intelligence
"What is Data Processing?
Data processing means to processing of data i.e. to convert its format. As we all know data is the very useful and when it is well presented, and it becomes informative and useful. Data processing process system is also referred as information system. It is also right to say that data processing becomes the process of converting information into data and also vice-versa.

What is Data Processing?

Processing Data vs Processed Data
Processing data definition involves defining and managing the structure, characteristics, and specifications of data within an organization.

Processed data definition typically refers to the refined and finalized specifications and attributes associated with data after it has undergone various processing steps.


Processing Data reflects the ongoing activities to improve data quality, while processed data represents the outcome of those activities—a refined and organized dataset that is poised for effective utilization. Both stages are integral to the data management lifecycle, contributing to the overall success of data-driven initiatives and informed decision-making within organizations.


In simple words, processing of data can be expressed as:

Process of conversion of data in the computer understandable format.
The sorting or processing of data by a computer.
Stages of Data Processing Process
Data processing process involves a series of stages to transform raw data into meaningful information. Here are the six fundamental stages of data processing process:

1. Collection
The process begins with the collection of raw data from various sources. The stage establishes the foundation for subsequent processing, ensuring a comprehensive pool of data relevant to the intended analysis. It could include surveys, sensors, databases, or any other means of gathering relevant information.

2. Preparation
Data preparation focuses on organizing, data cleaning, and formatting raw data. Irrelevant information is filtered out, errors are corrected, and the data is structured in a way that facilitates efficient analysis during subsequent stages of processing.

3. Input
During the data input stage, the prepared data is entered into a computer system. This can be achieved through manual entry or automated methods, depending on the nature of the data and the systems in place.

4.Data Processing
The core of data processing involves manipulating and analyzing the prepared data. Operations such as sorting, summarizing, calculating, and aggregating are performed to extract meaningful insights and patterns.

5. Data Output
The results of data processing are presented in a comprehensible format during the data output stage. This could include reports, charts, graphs, or other visual representations that facilitate understanding and decision-making based on the analyzed data.

6. Data Storage
The final stage entails storing the processed data for future reference and analysis. This is crucial for maintaining a historical record, enabling efficient retrieval, and supporting ongoing or future data-related initiatives. Proper data storage ensures the longevity and accessibility of valuable information.",technical,,Artificial Intelligence
"Stages of Natural Language Generation
Content determination: Deciding the main content to be represented in a sentence or the information to mention in the text. For instance, in the pollen example above, deciding whether to explicitly mention that pollen level is 7 in the south-east.
Document structuring: Deciding the structure or organization of the conveyed information. For example, deciding to describe the areas with high pollen levels first, instead of the areas with low pollen levels.
Aggregation: Putting of similar sentences together to improve understanding and readability. For instance, merging the two sentences Grass pollen levels for Friday have increased from the moderate to high levels of yesterday and Grass pollen levels will be around 6 to 7 across most parts of the country into the single sentence Grass pollen levels for Friday have increased from the moderate to high levels of yesterday with values of around 6 to 7 across most parts of the country.
Lexical choice: Using appropriate words that convey the meaning clearly. For example, deciding whether medium or moderate should be used when describing a pollen level of 4.
Referring expression generation: Creating such referral expressions that help in identification of a particular object and region. For example, deciding to use in the Northern Isles and far northeast of mainland Scotland to refer to a certain region in Scotland.

"How does NLG work?
Natural Language Generation (NLG) is a branch of AI that focuses on the automatic generation of human-like language from data. NLG systems take structured data as input and convert it into coherent, contextually relevant human-readable text. The goal is for the generated text to sound like it was written by a human.

Here’s a high-level overview of how Natural Language Generation works:

Data Input: Structured data is the first input used by NLG systems. This information may originate from a number of sources, including spreadsheets, databases, and other organised formats.

Content Planning: Based on an analysis of the input data, the system decides what details to include in the text that is generated. Making choices regarding the selection of content, arrangement, and general structure is required.

Text Planning: The NLG system arranges the content’s natural language expression after it has been decided upon. It chooses the right wording, tone, and style for the text that is generated.

Sentence Generation: Using the planned content as a guide, the system generates individual sentences. Choosing the right words, phrases, and syntactic structures is necessary for this. While some NLG systems generate text using pre-defined templates, others might use more advanced techniques like machine learning.

Coherence and Consistency: Text produced by NLG systems should be consistent and coherent. This entails making certain that the sentences that are produced follow grammatical and stylistic conventions and flow naturally. It might also entail continuing to produce content that is consistent with earlier works.

Refinement: To raise the calibre of the produced text, a refinement procedure may be used. This could entail doing extra proofreading for naturalness, clarity, and grammar.",technical,,Artificial Intelligence
"What is Natural Language Generation (NLG)?
Natural Language Generation (NLG) simply means producing text from computer data. It acts as a translator and converts the computerized data into natural language representation. In this, a conclusion or text is generated based on collected data and input provided by the user. It is the natural language processing task of generating natural language from a machine representation system. Natural Language Generation in a way acts contrary to Natural language understanding. In natural language understanding the system needs to disambiguate the input sentence to produce the machine representation language, whereas in Natural Language Generation the system needs to make decisions about how to put a concept into words.

The process of generating text can be as simple as keeping a list of readymade text that is copied and pasted. Consequences can either be satisfactory in simple applications such as horoscope machines or generators of personalized business letters. However, a sophisticated NLG system is required to include stages of planning and merging of information to generate text that looks natural and does not become repetitive.

An example of a simple NLG system is the Pollen Forecast for Scotland system which could essentially be a template. NLG system takes as input six numbers, which predict the pollen levels in different parts of Scotland. From these numbers, a short textual summary of pollen levels is generated by the system as its output.

For example, using the historical data for 1 July 2005, the software produces Grass pollen levels for Friday have increased from the moderate to high levels of yesterday with values of around 6 to 7 across most parts of the country. However, pollen levels will be moderate with values of 4, in Northern areas. In contrast, the actual forecast, which was written by a human meteorologist, from this data was Pollen counts are expected to remain high at level 6 over most of Scotland, and even level 7 in the south-east. The only relief is in the Northern Isles and far northeast of mainland Scotland with medium levels of pollen count.",technical,,Artificial Intelligence

"Basic Charts for Data Visualization
These are the charts you'll face when starting with data visualization. They are simple to create easy to understand and help you start making sense of your data right away. we use Python libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to create these type of charts.

1. Bar Charts
Bar charts are one of the common visualization tool used to compare facts by showing square bars. A bar chart has X and Y Axis where the X Axis represents the types and the Y axis represents the price. There are various types of Bar charts like horizontal bar chart, Stacked bar chart, Grouped bar chart and Diverging bar Chart.

When to Use Bar Chart:

Comparing Categories: Used to show differences between categories and understand relationships in the data.
Ranking: When we got records with categories need to be arranged from highest to lowest we use bar charts.
Relationship between categories: When you have a dataset with multiple specific variables it can help to display relationship between them to discover patterns and tendencies.
2. Line Charts
Line chart is a type of graph that displays information over time. It uses markers to represent data points and these dots are connected by lines to show how the values change over a period. This makes easy to see trends such as whether something is increasing, decreasing, or staying the same.

When to Use Line Chart:

Line charts can be used to analyze developments over individual values.
Line charts also are used in comparing trends among more than one facts series.
Line chart is also used for time series information.
3. Pie Charts
A pie chart is a circular visualization divided into slices to show numerical percentages of a whole. Each slice represents a category and its size is proportional to the share it represents. They are only valid with small variety of categories. Simple Pie chart and Exploded Pie charts are distinctive varieties of Pie charts.

When to Use Pie Chart:

To show how parts make up a whole.
Useful in emphasizing a particular category by way of highlighting a dominant slice.
4. Scatter Chart (Plots)
A scatter chart is a tool that uses dots to represent data points showing the relationship between two numerical variables. The X-axis represents the independent variable and the Y-axis represents the dependent variable. Type of scatter chart consists of simple scatter chart, scatter chart with trendline and scatter chart with coloration coding. They are used for identifying outliers or unusual remark for your facts.

5. ﻿Histogram
A histogram shows the distribution of numerical data by dividing it into intervals (bins) and displaying the frequency of data points as bars. It helps visualize patterns like skewness, central tendency, and variability.

When to Use Histogram:

Distribution Visualization: Histograms are best for visualizing the distribution of numerical information allow customers to recognize shape of the records.
Data Exploration: It provides records exploration by using revealing patterns, trends, and outliers inside datasets.",technical,,Artificial Intelligence

"Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It provides valuable insights for prediction and data analysis. This article will explore its types, assumptions, implementation, advantages, and evaluation metrics.

Understanding Linear Regression
Linear regression is also a type of supervised machine-learning algorithm that learns from the labelled datasets and maps the data points with most optimized linear functions which can be used for prediction on new datasets. It computes the linear relationship between the dependent variable and one or more independent features by fitting a linear equation with observed data. It predicts the continuous output variables based on the independent input variable.

For example if we want to predict house price we consider various factor such as house age, distance from the main road, location, area and number of room, linear regression uses all these parameter to predict house price as it consider a linear relation between all these features and price of house.

Why Linear Regression is Important?
The interpretability of linear regression is one of its greatest strengths. The model’s equation offers clear coefficients that illustrate the influence of each independent variable on the dependent variable, enhancing our understanding of the underlying relationships. Its simplicity is a significant advantage; linear regression is transparent, easy to implement, and serves as a foundational concept for more advanced algorithms.

Now that we have discussed why linear regression is important now we will discuss its working based on best fit line in regression.

What is the best Fit Line?
Our primary objective while using linear regression is to locate the best-fit line, which implies that the error between the predicted and actual values should be kept to a minimum. There will be the least error in the best-fit line.

The best Fit Line equation provides a straight line that represents the relationship between the dependent and independent variables. The slope of the line indicates how much the dependent variable changes for a unit change in the independent variable(s).",technical,,Artificial Intelligence
"Regression in machine learning
Last Updated : 13 Jan, 2025
Regression in machine learning refers to a supervised learning technique where the goal is to predict a continuous numerical value based on one or more independent features. It finds relationships between variables so that predictions can be made. we have two types of variables present in regression:

Dependent Variable (Target): The variable we are trying to predict e.g house price.
Independent Variables (Features): The input variables that influence the prediction e.g locality, number of rooms.
Regression analysis problem works with if output variable is a real or continuous value such as “salary” or “weight”. Many different regression models can be used but the simplest model in them is linear regression.

Types of Regression
Regression can be classified into different types based on the number of predictor variables and the nature of the relationship between variables:

1. Simple Linear Regression
Linear regression is one of the simplest and most widely used statistical models. This assumes that there is a linear relationship between the independent and dependent variables. This means that the change in the dependent variable is proportional to the change in the independent variables. For example predicting the price of a house based on its size.

2. Multiple Linear Regression
Multiple linear regression extends simple linear regression by using multiple independent variables to predict target variable. For example predicting the price of a house based on multiple features such as size, location, number of rooms, etc.

3. Polynomial Regression
Polynomial regression is used to model with non-linear relationships between the dependent variable and the independent variables. It adds polynomial terms to the linear regression model to capture more complex relationships. For example when we want to predict a non-linear trend like population growth over time we use polynomial regression.

4. Ridge & Lasso Regression
Ridge & lasso regression are regularized versions of linear regression that help avoid overfitting by penalizing large coefficients. When there’s a risk of overfitting due to too many features we use these type of regression algorithms.

5. Support Vector Regression (SVR)
SVR is a type of regression algorithm that is based on the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. SVM is a type of algorithm that is used for classification tasks but it can also be used for regression tasks. SVR works by finding a hyperplane that minimizes the sum of the squared residuals between the predicted and actual values.

6. Decision Tree Regression
Decision tree Uses a tree-like structure to make decisions where each branch of tree represents a decision and leaves represent outcomes. For example predicting customer behavior based on features like age, income, etc there we use decison tree regression.

7. Random Forest Regression
Random Forest is a ensemble method that builds multiple decision trees and each tree is trained on a different subset of the training data. The final prediction is made by averaging the predictions of all of the trees. For example customer churn or sales data using this.",technical,,Artificial Intelligence
"Examples of Machine Learning Classification in Real Life
Classification algorithms are widely used in many real-world applications across various domains, including:

Email spam filtering
Credit risk assessment: Algorithms predict whether a loan applicant is likely to default by analyzing factors such as credit score, income, and loan history. This helps banks make informed lending decisions and minimize financial risk.
Medical diagnosis : Machine learning models classify whether a patient has a certain condition (e.g., cancer or diabetes) based on medical data such as test results, symptoms, and patient history. This aids doctors in making quicker, more accurate diagnoses, improving patient care.
Image classification : Applied in fields such as facial recognition, autonomous driving, and medical imaging.
Sentiment analysis: Determining whether the sentiment of a piece of text is positive, negative, or neutral. Businesses use this to understand customer opinions, helping to improve products and services.
Fraud detection : Algorithms detect fraudulent activities by analyzing transaction patterns and identifying anomalies crucial in protecting against credit card fraud and other financial crimes.
Recommendation systems : Used to recommend products or content based on past user behavior, such as suggesting movies on Netflix or products on Amazon. This personalization boosts user satisfaction and sales for businesses.",technical,,Artificial Intelligence
"How does Classification in Machine Learning Work?
Classification involves training a model using a labeled dataset, where each input is paired with its correct output label. The model learns patterns and relationships in the data, so it can later predict labels for new, unseen inputs.

In machine learning, classification works by training a model to learn patterns from labeled data, so it can predict the category or class of new, unseen data. Here’s how it works:

Data Collection: You start with a dataset where each item is labeled with the correct class (for example, “cat” or “dog”).
Feature Extraction: The system identifies features (like color, shape, or texture) that help distinguish one class from another. These features are what the model uses to make predictions.
Model Training: Classification – machine learning algorithm uses the labeled data to learn how to map the features to the correct class. It looks for patterns and relationships in the data.
Model Evaluation: Once the model is trained, it’s tested on new, unseen data to check how accurately it can classify the items.
Prediction: After being trained and evaluated, the model can be used to predict the class of new data based on the features it has learned.
Model Evaluation: Evaluating a classification model is a key step in machine learning. It helps us check how well the model performs and how good it is at handling new, unseen data. Depending on the problem and needs we can use different metrics to measure its performance",technical,,Artificial Intelligence
"Classification teaches a machine to sort things into categories. It learns by looking at examples with labels (like emails marked “spam” or “not spam”). After learning, it can decide which category new items belong to, like identifying if a new email is spam or not. For example a classification model might be trained on dataset of images labeled as either dogs or cats and it can be used to predict the class of new and unseen images as dogs or cats based on their features such as color, texture and shape.

Getting-started-with-Classification
Getting started with Classification

Explaining classification in ml, horizontal axis represents the combined values of color and texture features. Vertical axis represents the combined values of shape and size features.

Each colored dot in the plot represents an individual image, with the color indicating whether the model predicts the image to be a dog or a cat.
The shaded areas in the plot show the decision boundary, which is the line or region that the model uses to decide which category (dog or cat) an image belongs to. The model classifies images on one side of the boundary as dogs and on the other side as cats, based on their features.
Types of Classification
When we talk about classification in machine learning, we’re talking about the process of sorting data into categories based on specific features or characteristics. There are different types of classification problems depending on how many categories (or classes) we are working with and how they are organized. There are two main classification types in machine learning:

1. Binary Classification
This is the simplest kind of classification. In binary classification, the goal is to sort the data into two distinct categories. Think of it like a simple choice between two options. Imagine a system that sorts emails into either spam or not spam. It works by looking at different features of the email like certain keywords or sender details, and decides whether it’s spam or not. It only chooses between these two options.

2. Multiclass Classification
Here, instead of just two categories, the data needs to be sorted into more than two categories. The model picks the one that best matches the input. Think of an image recognition system that sorts pictures of animals into categories like cat, dog, and bird.

Basically, machine looks at the features in the image (like shape, color, or texture) and chooses which animal the picture is most likely to be based on the training it received.",technical,,Artificial Intelligence
"Machine Learning Pipeline
Machine learning is fundamentally built upon data, which serves as the foundation for training and testing models. Data consists of inputs (features) and outputs (labels). A model learns patterns during training and is tested on unseen data to evaluate its performance and generalization. In order to make predictions, there are essential steps through which data passes in order to produce a machine learning model that can make predictions.",technical,,Artificial Intelligence
"Machine learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that enables computers to learn from data and make predictions without being explicitly programmed.

Supervised Learning: Trains models on labeled data to predict or classify new, unseen data.
Unsupervised Learning: Finds patterns or groups in unlabeled data, like clustering or dimensionality reduction.
Reinforcement Learning: Learns through trial and error to maximize rewards, ideal for decision-making tasks.

Self-Supervised Learning creates its own labels from raw data, allowing it to learn patterns without needing labeled examples. ",technical,,Artificial Intelligence
"n this Python for Data Science guide, we’ll explore the exciting world of Python and its wide-ranging applications in data science. We will also explore a variety of data science techniques used in data science using the Python programming language.

We all know that data Science is applied to gather multiple data sets to collect information, project the insight, and interpret it to make an effective business decision. However, being a data scientist requires you to learn some of the best and most highly used programming languages, such as Java , C++ , R , Python, etc . Among these, Python has been considered the preferred choice among data scientists throughout the globe.

Why Python is Important For Data Science?
Python has been in demand for the past few years and the recent survey also suggested the same, Python leads the chart among the top programming languages in both the TIOBE index & PYPL Index. However, to support this, there are 5 concrete reasons behind this,

Easy To Learn: Being an open-source platform, Python has a simple and intuitive syntax that is easy to learn and read. This makes it a great language for beginners to learn data science.
Cross-Platform: Being a developer, you don’t need to worry about the data types. The reason is, Python allows developers to run the code on Windows, Mac OS X, UNIX, and Linux.
Portable: Being an easy & beginner’s friendly programming language, Python is highly portable in nature which means that a developer can run their code on different machines without making any further changes.
Extensive Library : Python has several powerful libraries that make data analysis and visualization easy. Pandas is a library for data manipulation and analysis, NumPy is a library for numerical computation, and Matplotlib is a library for data visualization.
Community Support: Python has a large and active community that supports and contributes to the development of various libraries and tools for data science. This community has created many useful libraries, including Pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, and SciPy, which are widely used in data science.
However, there are a lot more reasons to opt for Python for Data Science such as OOP, expressive language, the ability to allocate memory dynamically, etc. and that’s the reason for using Python Programming Language for Data Science applications.

"n this article,we will be discussing univariate, bivariate, and multivariate data and their analysis.

Univariate data: 
Univariate data refers to a type of data in which each observation or data point corresponds to a single variable. In other words, it involves the measurement or observation of a single characteristic or attribute for each individual or item in the dataset. Analyzing univariate data is the simplest form of analysis in statistics.

Heights (in cm)

164

167.3

170

174.2

178

180

186

Suppose that the heights of seven students in a class is recorded (above table). There is only one variable, which is height, and it is not dealing with any cause or relationship.

Key points in Univariate analysis:
No Relationships: Univariate analysis focuses solely on describing and summarizing the distribution of the single variable. It does not explore relationships between variables or attempt to identify causes.
Descriptive Statistics: Descriptive statistics, such as measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) and measures of dispersion (range, standard deviation), are commonly used in the analysis of univariate data.
Visualization: Histograms, box plots, and other graphical representations are often used to visually represent the distribution of the single variable.
Bivariate data 
Bivariate data involves two different variables, and the analysis of this type of data focuses on understanding the relationship or association between these two variables. Example of bivariate data can be temperature and ice cream sales in summer season.

Temperature

Ice Cream Sales

20

2000

25

2500

35

5000

Suppose the temperature and ice cream sales are the two variables of a bivariate data(table 2). Here, the relationship is visible from the table that temperature and sales are directly proportional to each other and thus related because as the temperature increases, the sales also increase.

Key points in Bivariate analysis:
Relationship Analysis: The primary goal of analyzing bivariate data is to understand the relationship between the two variables. This relationship could be positive (both variables increase together), negative (one variable increases while the other decreases), or show no clear pattern.
Scatterplots: A common visualization tool for bivariate data is a scatterplot, where each data point represents a pair of values for the two variables. Scatterplots help visualize patterns and trends in the data.
Correlation Coefficient: A quantitative measure called the correlation coefficient is often used to quantify the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables. The correlation coefficient ranges from -1 to 1.
Multivariate data 
Multivariate data refers to datasets where each observation or sample point consists of multiple variables or features. These variables can represent different aspects, characteristics, or measurements related to the observed phenomenon. When dealing with three or more variables, the data is specifically categorized as multivariate.

Example of this type of data is suppose an advertiser wants to compare the popularity of four advertisements on a website.

80

Ad3

Ad3

Male

35

The click rates could be measured for both men and women and relationships between variables can then be examined. It is similar to bivariate but contains more than one dependent variable.

Key points in Multivariate analysis:
Analysis Techniques:The ways to perform analysis on this data depends on the goals to be achieved. Some of the techniques are regression analysis, principal component analysis, path analysis, factor analysis and multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA).
Goals of Analysis: The choice of analysis technique depends on the specific goals of the study. For example, researchers may be interested in predicting one variable based on others, identifying underlying factors that explain patterns, or comparing group means across multiple variables.
Interpretation: Multivariate analysis allows for a more nuanced interpretation of complex relationships within the data. It helps uncover patterns that may not be apparent when examining variables individually",technical,,Artificial Intelligence

What is Machine Learning?
Machine Learning is the general term for when computers learn from data. It describes the intersection of computer science and statistics where algorithms are used to perform a specific task without being explicitly programmed; instead, they recognize patterns in the data and make predictions once new data arrives.

In general, the learning process of these algorithms can either be supervised or unsupervised, depending on the data being used to feed the algorithms. If you want to dive in a little bit deeper into the differences between supervised and unsupervised learning have a read through this article.

A traditional Machine Learning algorithm can be something as simple as linear regression. For instance, imagine you want to predict your income given your years of higher education. In the first step, you have to define a function, e.g. income = y + x * years of education. Then, give your algorithm a set of training data. This could be a simple table with data on some people’s years of higher education and their associated income. Next, let your algorithm draw the line, e.g. through an ordinary least squares (OLS) regression. Now, you can give the algorithm some test data, e.g. your personal years of higher education, and let it predict your income.

While this example sounds simple it does count as Machine Learning – and yes, the driving force behind Machine Learning is ordinary statistics. The algorithm learned to make a prediction without being explicitly programmed, only based on patterns and inference.

So much about Machine Learning in general – to summarize:

Machine Learning is at the intersection of computer science and statistics through which computers receive the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.
There are two broad categories of Machine Learning problems: supervised and unsupervised learning.
A Machine Learning algorithm can be something as simple as an OLS regression.
Let's now examine how the term Deep Learning relates to all of this.

What is Deep Learning?
Deep Learning algorithms can be regarded both as a sophisticated and mathematically complex evolution of machine learning algorithms. The field has been getting lots of attention lately and for good reason: Recent developments have led to results that were not thought to be possible before.

Deep Learning describes algorithms that analyze data with a logical structure similar to how a human would draw conclusions. Note that this can happen both through supervised and unsupervised learning. To achieve this, Deep Learning applications use a layered structure of algorithms called an artificial neural network (ANN). The design of such an ANN is inspired by the biological neural network of the human brain, leading to a process of learning that’s far more capable than that of standard machine learning models.

Understanding deep learning means understanding neural networks
A simple artificial neural network
Consider the example ANN in the image above. The leftmost layer is called the input layer, the rightmost layer of the output layer. The middle layers are called hidden layers because their values aren't observable in the training set. In simple terms, hidden layers are calculated values used by the network to do its ""magic"". The more hidden layers a network has between the input and output layer, the deeper it is. In general, any ANN with two or more hidden layers is referred to as a deep neural network.

Today, Deep Learning is used in many fields. In automated driving, for instance, Deep Learning is used to detect objects, such as STOP signs or pedestrians. The military uses Deep Learning to identify objects from satellites, e.g. to discover safe or unsafe zones for its troops. Of course, the consumer electronics industry is full of Deep Learning, too. Home assistance devices such as Amazon Alexa, for example, rely on Deep Learning algorithms to respond to your voice and know your preferences.

How about a more concrete example? Imagine the company Tesla using a Deep Learning algorithm for its cars to recognize STOP signs. In the first step, the ANN would identify the relevant properties of the STOP sign, also called features. Features may be specific structures in the inputted image, such as points, edges, or objects. While a software engineer would have to select the relevant features in a more traditional Machine Learning algorithm, the ANN is capable of automatic feature engineering. The first hidden layer might learn how to detect edges, the next is how to differentiate colors, and the last learn how to detect more complex shapes catered specifically to the shape of the object we are trying to recognize. When fed with training data, the Deep Learning algorithms would eventually learn from their own errors whether the prediction was good, or whether it needs to adjust.",technical,,Artificial Intelligence
"AI (Artificial Intelligence) and machine learning are related but distinct concepts within the field of computer science and artificial intelligence.

Artificial Intelligence (AI):

AI is a broad term that refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. The goal of AI is to create intelligent agents that can perceive their environment, reason about it, and make decisions to achieve specific objectives. AI encompasses a wide range of techniques, methodologies, and algorithms that aim to replicate human-like cognitive abilities.

AI can be categorized into two main types:

a. Narrow AI (Weak AI): Narrow AI refers to AI systems that are designed and trained for a specific task or set of tasks. These systems are specialized and excel in performing the specific tasks they are designed for but lack general intelligence. Examples include virtual personal assistants (like Siri or Alexa), image recognition systems, and recommendation algorithms.

b. General AI (Strong AI): General AI, also known as strong AI or AGI (Artificial General Intelligence), refers to AI systems that possess human-level intelligence and can understand, learn, and apply knowledge across a wide range of tasks, similar to a human being. This level of AI is still a theoretical concept and has not been achieved yet.

Machine Learning:

Machine learning is a subfield of AI that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that allow computers to learn from data and improve their performance on a specific task without being explicitly programmed. Instead of using rule-based instructions, machine learning algorithms rely on patterns and inferences derived from data.

There are three main types of machine learning:

a. Supervised Learning: In supervised learning, the algorithm is trained on labeled data, where the input and the corresponding output are provided. The algorithm learns to map inputs to outputs, making predictions on new, unseen data.

b. Unsupervised Learning: In unsupervised learning, the algorithm is given unlabeled data and must find patterns or structures within the data on its own, without explicit guidance on what to look for.

c. Reinforcement Learning: In reinforcement learning, an agent learns to make decisions in an environment to achieve a specific goal. It receives feedback in the form of rewards or penalties for its actions and uses this information to improve its decision-making capabilities over time.

In summary, AI is the broader concept that involves creating intelligent systems to perform tasks, while machine learning is a subset of AI that focuses on the development of algorithms that enable machines to learn and improve from data.

What is Machine Learning?
Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of Data Science that focuses on building algorithms and models that enable computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. 
Instead of following pre-defined instructions, a machine learning model improves its performance over time by recognizing patterns in the data.

Core Concepts of Machine Learning


Core Concepts of machine Learning-Data Science Course in Hyderabad
Supervised Learning – Involves training a model using labeled data, where the desired output is already known. 

Example: Spam email detection, where emails are labeled as ""spam"" or ""not spam.""

Unsupervised Learning – The model is given unlabeled data and must find hidden patterns or groupings in the data.
Reinforcement Learning – A model learns by interacting with its environment, receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties to maximize a goal.
Model Training & Evaluation – A model is trained on data to learn patterns, and its performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, etc.
Feature Engineering – The process of selecting and transforming variables in the data to improve the model's performance.

How Machine Learning Differs from Traditional Programming
In traditional programming, a developer writes explicit instructions for the computer to follow in order to solve a problem. The program processes input data using predefined rules and produces an output.
 In contrast, Machine Learning uses algorithms that learn from data. Instead of manually coding every rule, you provide data to the machine learning model, which adjusts itself over time to improve predictions or decisions. This allows machines to solve more complex problems, adapt to new data, and even make decisions on their own.

Key Differences:

Traditional Programming: Rules are written by humans, and the computer follows them.
Machine Learning: The model learns from the data itself, adjusting and improving based on feedback.

Machine learning is incredibly powerful for solving complex problems like image recognition, speech recognition, and natural language processing, where defining rules manually would be impractical

"Controversies Surrounding Natural Language Processing (NLP)
NLP has been at the center of a number of controversies. Some are centered directly on the models and their outputs, others on second-order concerns, such as who has access to these systems, and how training them impacts the natural world. 

Stochastic parrots: A 2021 paper titled “On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots: Can Language Models Be Too Big?” by Emily Bender, Timnit Gebru, Angelina McMillan-Major, and Margaret Mitchell examines how language models may repeat and amplify biases found in their training data. The authors point out that huge, uncurated datasets scraped from the web are bound to include social biases and other undesirable information, and models that are trained on them will absorb these flaws. They advocate greater care in curating and documenting datasets, evaluating a model’s potential impact prior to development, and encouraging research in directions other than designing ever-larger architectures to ingest ever-larger datasets.
Coherence versus sentience: Recently, a Google engineer tasked with evaluating the LaMDA language model was so impressed by the quality of its chat output that he believed it to be sentient. The fallacy of attributing human-like intelligence to AI dates back to some of the earliest NLP experiments. 
Environmental impact: Large language models require a lot of energy during both training and inference. One study estimated that training a single large language model can emit five times as much carbon dioxide as a single automobile over its operational lifespan. Another study found that models consume even more energy during inference than training. As for solutions, researchers have proposed using cloud servers located in countries with lots of renewable energy as one way to offset this impact. 
High cost leaves out non-corporate researchers: The computational requirements needed to train or deploy large language models are too expensive for many small companies. Some experts worry that this could block many capable engineers from contributing to innovation in AI. 
Black box: When a deep learning model renders an output, it’s difficult or impossible to know why it generated that particular result. While traditional models like logistic regression enable engineers to examine the impact on the output of individual features, neural network methods in natural language processing are essentially black boxes. Such systems are said to be “not explainable,” since we can’t explain how they arrived at their output. An effective approach to achieve explainability is especially important in areas like banking, where regulators want to confirm that a natural language processing system doesn’t discriminate against some groups of people, and law enforcement, where models trained on historical data may perpetuate historical biases against certain groups.
“Nonsense on stilts”: Writer Gary Marcus has criticized deep learning-based NLP for generating sophisticated language that misleads users to believe that natural language algorithms understand what they are saying and mistakenly assume they are capable of more sophisticated reasoning than is currently possible",technical,,Artificial Intelligence
"Six Important Natural Language Processing (NLP) Models
Over the years, many NLP models have made waves within the AI community, and some have even made headlines in the mainstream news. The most famous of these have been chatbots and language models. Here are some of them:

Eliza was developed in the mid-1960s to try to solve the Turing Test; that is, to fool people into thinking they’re conversing with another human being rather than a machine. Eliza used pattern matching and a series of rules without encoding the context of the language.
Tay was a chatbot that Microsoft launched in 2016. It was supposed to tweet like a teen and learn from conversations with real users on Twitter. The bot adopted phrases from users who tweeted sexist and racist comments, and Microsoft deactivated it not long afterward. Tay illustrates some points made by the “Stochastic Parrots” paper, particularly the danger of not debiasing data.
BERT and his Muppet friends: Many deep learning models for NLP are named after Muppet characters, including ELMo, BERT, Big BIRD, ERNIE, Kermit, Grover, RoBERTa, and Rosita. Most of these models are good at providing contextual embeddings and enhanced knowledge representation.
Generative Pre-Trained Transformer 3 (GPT-3) is a 175 billion parameter model that can write original prose with human-equivalent fluency in response to an input prompt. The model is based on the transformer architecture. The previous version, GPT-2, is open source. Microsoft acquired an exclusive license to access GPT-3’s underlying model from its developer OpenAI, but other users can interact with it via an application programming interface (API). Several groups including EleutherAI and Meta have released open source interpretations of GPT-3. 
Language Model for Dialogue Applications (LaMDA) is a conversational chatbot developed by Google. LaMDA is a transformer-based model trained on dialogue rather than the usual web text. The system aims to provide sensible and specific responses to conversations. Google developer Blake Lemoine came to believe that LaMDA is sentient. Lemoine had detailed conversations with AI about his rights and personhood. During one of these conversations, the AI changed Lemoine’s mind about Isaac Asimov’s third law of robotics. Lemoine claimed that LaMDA was sentient, but the idea was disputed by many observers and commentators. Subsequently, Google placed Lemoine on administrative leave for distributing proprietary information and ultimately fired him.
Mixture of Experts (MoE): While most deep learning models use the same set of parameters to process every input, MoE models aim to provide different parameters for different inputs based on efficient routing algorithms to achieve higher performance. Switch Transformer is an example of the MoE approach that aims to reduce communication and computational costs.",technical,,Artificial Intelligence
"Top Natural Language Processing (NLP) Techniques
Most of the NLP tasks discussed above can be modeled by a dozen or so general techniques. It’s helpful to think of these techniques in two categories: Traditional machine learning methods and deep learning methods. 

Traditional Machine learning NLP techniques: 

Logistic regression is a supervised classification algorithm that aims to predict the probability that an event will occur based on some input. In NLP, logistic regression models can be applied to solve problems such as sentiment analysis, spam detection, and toxicity classification.
Naive Bayes is a supervised classification algorithm that finds the conditional probability distribution P(label | text) using the following Bayes formula:
P(label | text) = P(label) x P(text|label) / P(text) 

and predicts based on which joint distribution has the highest probability. The naive assumption in the Naive Bayes model is that the individual words are independent. Thus: 

P(text|label) = P(word_1|label)*P(word_2|label)*…P(word_n|label)

In NLP, such statistical methods can be applied to solve problems such as spam detection or finding bugs in software code. 

Decision trees are a class of supervised classification models that split the dataset based on different features to maximize information gain in those splits.",technical,,Artificial Intelligence
"NLP use cases by industry
NLP applications can now be found across virtually every industry.

Finance
In financial dealings, nanoseconds might make the difference between success and failure when accessing data, or making trades or deals. NLP can speed the mining of information from financial statements, annual and regulatory reports, news releases or even social media.

Healthcare
New medical insights and breakthroughs can arrive faster than many healthcare professionals can keep up. NLP and AI-based tools can help speed the analysis of health records and medical research papers, making better-informed medical decisions possible, or assisting in the detection or even prevention of medical conditions.

Insurance
NLP can analyze claims to look for patterns that can identify areas of concern and find inefficiencies in claims processing—leading to greater optimization of processing and employee efforts.

Legal
Almost any legal case might require reviewing mounds of paperwork, background information and legal precedent. NLP can help automate legal discovery, assisting in the organization of information, speeding review and making sure that all relevant details are captured for consideration.",technical,,Artificial Intelligence
"Challenges of NLP 
Even state-of-the-art NLP models are not perfect, just as human speech is prone to error. As with any AI technology, NLP comes with potential pitfalls. Human language is filled with ambiguities that make it difficult for programmers to write software that accurately determines the intended meaning of text or voice data. Human language might take years for humans to learn—and many never stop learning. But then programmers must teach natural language-powered applications to recognize and understand irregularities so their applications can be accurate and useful. Associated risks might include:

Biased training
As with any AI function, biased data used in training will skew the answers. The more diverse the users of an NLP function, the more significant this risk becomes, such as in government services, healthcare and HR interactions. Training datasets scraped from the web, for example, are prone to bias.

Misinterpretation
As in programming, there is a risk of garbage in, garbage out (GIGO). Speech recognition, also known as speech-to-text, is the task of reliably converting voice data into text data. But NLP solutions can become confused if spoken input is in an obscure dialect, mumbled, too full of slang, homonyms, incorrect grammar, idioms, fragments, mispronunciations, contractions or recorded with too much background noise.

New vocabulary
New words are continually being invented or imported. The conventions of grammar can evolve or be intentionally broken. In these cases, NLP can either make a best guess or admit it’s unsure—and either way, this creates a complication.

Tone of voice
When people speak, their verbal delivery or even body language can give an entirely different meaning than the words alone. Exaggeration for effect, stressing words for importance or sarcasm can be confused by NLP, making the semantic analysis more difficult and less reliable.",technical,,Artificial Intelligence
"How NLP works
NLP works by combining various computational techniques to analyze, understand and generate human language in a way that machines can process. Here is an overview of a typical NLP pipeline and its steps:

Text preprocessing
NLP text preprocessing prepares raw text for analysis by transforming it into a format that machines can more easily understand. It begins with tokenization, which involves splitting the text into smaller units like words, sentences or phrases. This helps break down complex text into manageable parts. Next, lowercasing is applied to standardize the text by converting all characters to lowercase, ensuring that words like ""Apple"" and ""apple"" are treated the same. Stop word removal is another common step, where frequently used words like ""is"" or ""the"" are filtered out because they don't add significant meaning to the text. Stemming or lemmatization reduces words to their root form (e.g., ""running"" becomes ""run""), making it easier to analyze language by grouping different forms of the same word. Additionally, text cleaning removes unwanted elements such as punctuation, special characters and numbers that may clutter the analysis.

After preprocessing, the text is clean, standardized and ready for machine learning models to interpret effectively.

Feature extraction
Feature extraction is the process of converting raw text into numerical representations that machines can analyze and interpret. This involves transforming text into structured data by using NLP techniques like Bag of Words and TF-IDF, which quantify the presence and importance of words in a document. More advanced methods include word embeddings like Word2Vec or GloVe, which represent words as dense vectors in a continuous space, capturing semantic relationships between words. Contextual embeddings further enhance this by considering the context in which words appear, allowing for richer, more nuanced representations.

Text analysis
Text analysis involves interpreting and extracting meaningful information from text data through various computational techniques. This process includes tasks such as part-of-speech (POS) tagging, which identifies grammatical roles of words and named entity recognition (NER), which detects specific entities like names, locations and dates. Dependency parsing analyzes grammatical relationships between words to understand sentence structure, while sentiment analysis determines the emotional tone of the text, assessing whether it is positive, negative or neutral. Topic modeling identifies underlying themes or topics within a text or across a corpus of documents. Natural language understanding (NLU) is a subset of NLP that focuses on analyzing the meaning behind sentences. NLU enables software to find similar meanings in different sentences or to process words that have different meanings. Through these techniques, NLP text analysis transforms unstructured text into insights.

Model training
Processed data is then used to train machine learning models, which learn patterns and relationships within the data. During training, the model adjusts its parameters to minimize errors and improve its performance. Once trained, the model can be used to make predictions or generate outputs on new, unseen data. The effectiveness of NLP modeling is continually refined through evaluation, validation and fine-tuning to enhance accuracy and relevance in real-world applications.

Different software environments are useful throughout the said processes. For example, the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) is a suite of libraries and programs for English that is written in the Python programming language. It supports text classification, tokenization, stemming, tagging, parsing and semantic reasoning functionalities. TensorFlow is a free and open-source software library for machine learning and AI that can be used to train models for NLP applications. Tutorials and certifications abound for those interested in familiarizing themselves with such tools.",technical,,Artificial Intelligence
"NLP Tasks
Several NLP tasks typically help process human text and voice data in ways that help the computer make sense of what it’s ingesting. Some of these tasks include:

Coreference resolution

Named entity recognition

Part-of-speech tagging

Word sense disambiguation

Coreference resolution
This is the task of identifying if and when two words refer to the same entity. The most common example is determining the person or object to which a certain pronoun refers (such as “she” = “Mary”). But it can also identify a metaphor or an idiom in the text (such as an instance in which “bear” isn’t an animal, but a large and hairy person). 

Named entity recognition (NER)
NER identifies words or phrases as useful entities. NER identifies “London” as a location or “Maria” as a person's name.

Part-of-speech tagging
Also called grammatical tagging, this is the process of determining which part of speech a word or piece of text is, based on its use and context. For example, part-of-speech identifies “make” as a verb in “I can make a paper plane,” and as a noun in “What make of car do you own?”

Word sense disambiguation
This is the selection of a word meaning for a word with multiple possible meanings. This uses a process of semantic analysis to examine the word in context. For example, word sense disambiguation helps distinguish the meaning of the verb “make” in “make the grade” (to achieve) versus “make a bet” (to place). Sorting out “I will be merry when I marry Mary” requires a sophisticated NLP system.",technical,,Artificial Intelligence
"Approaches to NLP
NLP combines the power of computational linguistics together with machine learning algorithms and deep learning. Computational linguistics uses data science to analyze language and speech. It includes two main types of analysis: syntactical analysis and semantical analysis. Syntactical analysis determines the meaning of a word, phrase or sentence by parsing the syntax of the words and applying preprogrammed rules of grammar. Semantical analysis uses the syntactic output to draw meaning from the words and interpret their meaning within the sentence structure.

The parsing of words can take one of two forms. Dependency parsing looks at the relationships between words, such as identifying nouns and verbs, while constituency parsing then builds a parse tree (or syntax tree): a rooted and ordered representation of the syntactic structure of the sentence or string of words. The resulting parse trees underly the functions of language translators and speech recognition. Ideally, this analysis makes the output—either text or speech—understandable to both NLP models and people.

Self-supervised learning (SSL) in particular is useful for supporting NLP because NLP requires large amounts of labeled data to train AI models. Because these labeled datasets require time-consuming annotation—a process involving manual labeling by humans—gathering sufficient data can be prohibitively difficult. Self-supervised approaches can be more time-effective and cost-effective, as they replace some or all manually labeled training data.
 
Three different approaches to NLP include:

Rules-based NLP
The earliest NLP applications were simple if-then decision trees, requiring preprogrammed rules. They are only able to provide answers in response to specific prompts, such as the original version of Moviefone, which had rudimentary natural language generation (NLG) capabilities. Because there is no machine learning or AI capability in rules-based NLP, this function is highly limited and not scalable.

Statistical NLP
Developed later, statistical NLP automatically extracts, classifies and labels elements of text and voice data and then assigns a statistical likelihood to each possible meaning of those elements. This relies on machine learning, enabling a sophisticated breakdown of linguistics such as part-of-speech tagging.
 
Statistical NLP introduced the essential technique of mapping language elements—such as words and grammatical rules—to a vector representation so that language can be modeled by using mathematical (statistical) methods, including regression or Markov models. This informed early NLP developments such as spellcheckers and T9 texting (Text on 9 keys, to be used on Touch-Tone telephones).

Deep learning NLP
Recently, deep learning models have become the dominant mode of NLP, by using huge volumes of raw, unstructured data—both text and voice—to become ever more accurate. Deep learning can be viewed as a further evolution of statistical NLP, with the difference that it uses neural network models. There are several subcategories of models:

Sequence-to-Sequence (seq2seq) models: Based on recurrent neural networks (RNN), they have mostly been used for machine translation by converting a phrase from one domain (such as the German language) into the phrase of another domain (such as English).

Transformer models: They use tokenization of language (the position of each token—words or subwords) and self-attention (capturing dependencies and relationships) to calculate the relation of different language parts to one another. Transformer models can be efficiently trained by using self-supervised learning on massive text databases. A landmark in transformer models was Google’s bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT), which became and remains the basis of how Google’s search engine works.

Autoregressive models: This type of transformer model is trained specifically to predict the next word in a sequence, which represents a huge leap forward in the ability to generate text. Examples of autoregressive LLMs include GPT, Llama, Claude and the open-source Mistral.

Foundation models: Prebuilt and curated foundation models can speed the launching of an NLP effort and boost trust in its operation. For example, the IBM® Granite™ foundation models are widely applicable across industries. They support NLP tasks including content generation and insight extraction. Additionally, they facilitate retrieval-augmented generation, a framework for improving the quality of response by linking the model to external sources of knowledge. The models also perform named entity recognition which involves identifying and extracting key information in a text.",technical,,Artificial Intelligence

"What is NLP?
Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of computer science and artificial intelligence (AI) that uses machine learning to enable computers to understand and communicate with human language.

NLP enables computers and digital devices to recognize, understand and generate text and speech by combining computational linguistics—the rule-based modeling of human language—together with statistical modeling, machine learning and deep learning.

NLP research has helped enable the era of generative AI, from the communication skills of large language models (LLMs) to the ability of image generation models to understand requests. NLP is already part of everyday life for many, powering search engines, prompting chatbots for customer service with spoken commands, voice-operated GPS systems and question-answering digital assistants on smartphones such as Amazon’s Alexa, Apple’s Siri and Microsoft’s Cortana.

NLP also plays a growing role in enterprise solutions that help streamline and automate business operations, increase employee productivity and simplify business processes.",technical,,Artificial Intelligence
"from machine learning
As our article on deep learning explains, deep learning is a subset of machine learning. The primary difference between machine learning and deep learning is how each algorithm learns and how much data each type of algorithm uses.

Deep learning automates much of the feature extraction piece of the process, eliminating some of the manual human intervention required. It also enables the use of large data sets, earning the title of scalable machine learning. That capability is exciting as we explore the use of unstructured data further, particularly since over 80% of an organization’s data is estimated to be unstructured.

Observing patterns in the data allows a deep-learning model to cluster inputs appropriately. Taking the same example from earlier, we might group pictures of pizzas, burgers and tacos into their respective categories based on the similarities or differences identified in the images. A deep-learning model requires more data points to improve accuracy, whereas a machine-learning model relies on less data given its underlying data structure. Enterprises generally use deep learning for more complex tasks, like virtual assistants or",technical,,Artificial Intelligence
"These computer science terms are often used interchangeably, but what differences make each a unique technology?

Technology is becoming more embedded in our daily lives by the minute. To keep up with the pace of consumer expectations, companies are relying more heavily on machine learning algorithms to make things easier. You can see its application in social media (through object recognition in photos) or in talking directly to devices (such as Alexa or Siri).

While artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), deep learning and neural networks are related technologies, the terms are often used interchangeably, which frequently leads to confusion about their differences. This blog post clarifies some of the ambiguity.",technical,,Artificial Intelligence
"Technological approaches to AGI
Goertzel and Pennachin state that there are at least three basic technological approaches to AGI systems, in terms of algorithms and model architectures.

Close emulation of the human brain in software: Given that the human brain is the only system we’re aware of that’s capable of general intelligence, a near-perfect emulation of it would theoretically yield similar intelligence. While artificial neural networks superficially replicate the brain’s basic mechanisms, the actual workings of the brain are far more varied and sophisticated than current deep learning models. Beyond the technological challenge of truly emulating the brain, this approach also requires a greater understanding of the brain’s machinations than we currently have.17

A novel model architecture, distinct from both the brain and from narrow AI architectures: This approach assumes that the brain is not the only structure conducive to general intelligence and that existing approaches to narrow AI can’t transcend their technological or conceptual limitations. AGI would thus require a new type of artificial intelligence. For example, LeCun has proposed eschewing autoregressive and other generative, probabilistic AI model architectures in favor of “Objective-Driven AI Systems” (link resides outside ibm.com) whose “world models” learn more like animals and children do.

An integrative approach, synthesizing narrow AI algorithms: This approach is the focus of most current real-world initiatives to achieve AGI, attempting to knit together the isolated progress that has been made on narrow AI tools such as LLMs, image models and reinforcement learning agents. Current multimodal models could be viewed as intermediate steps on this path. These integrative approaches typically use a central “agent” model—often an LLM—to navigate a decision-making process and automate the delegation of sub-tasks to specialist models.
 ",technical,,Artificial Intelligence
"Are LLMs already AGI?
Some researchers, such as Blase Agüera y Arcas and Peter Norvig, have argued that advanced LLMs such as Meta’s Llama, Open AI’s GPT and Anthropic’s Claude have already achieved AGI. They posit that generality is the key element of AGI and that today’s models can already discuss a wide range of topics, perform a wide range of tasks and process a diverse array of multimodal inputs. “’General intelligence’ must be thought of in terms of a multidimensional scorecard,” they posit. “Not a single yes or no proposition.”14

There are many detractors to this position. The authors of the DeepMind paper argue that generality itself does not qualify as AGI: it must be paired with a certain degree of performance. For example, if an LLM can write code, but that code isn’t reliable, then that generality “is not yet sufficiently performant.”

Yann LeCun, Meta’s chief AI scientist, has stated that LLMs lack AGI because they don’t have common sense: they can’t think before they act, can’t perform actions in the real world or learn through embodied experience and lack persistent memory and capacity for hierarchical planning.15 On a more fundamental level, LeCun and Jacob Browning have argued that “a system trained on language alone will never approximate human intelligence, even if trained from now until the heat death of the universe.”",technical,,Artificial Intelligence
"AGI vs. strong AI
""Strong AI,"" a concept discussed prominently in the work of philosopher John Searle, refers to an AI system demonstrating consciousness and serves mostly as a counterpoint to weak AI. While strong AI is generally analogous to AGI (and weak AI is generally analogous to narrow AI), they are not mere synonyms of one another.

In essence, whereas weak AI is simply a tool to be used by a conscious mind—that is, a human being—strong AI is itself a conscious mind. Though it is typically implied that this consciousness would entail a corresponding intelligence equal or superior to that of human beings, strong AI is not explicitly concerned with relative performance on various tasks. The two concepts are often conflated because consciousness is usually taken to be either a prerequisite or a consequence of “general intelligence.”

Despite their similarities, AGI and strong AI ultimately describe complementary concepts, rather than identical concepts.",technical,,Artificial Intelligence
"What are the technologies driving artificial general intelligence research?
AGI remains a distant goal for researchers. Efforts to build AGI systems are ongoing and encouraged by emerging developments. The following sections describe emerging technologies. 

Deep learning 
Deep learning is an AI discipline that focuses on training neural networks with multiple hidden layers to extract and understand complex relationships from raw data. AI experts use deep learning to build systems capable of understanding text, audio, images, video, and other information types. For example, developers use Amazon SageMaker to build lightweight deep learning models for the Internet of Things (IoT) and mobile devices. 

Generative AI
Generative artificial intelligence (generative AI) is a subset of deep learning wherein an AI system can produce unique and realistic content from learned knowledge. Generative AI models train with massive datasets, which enables them to respond to human queries with text, audio, or visuals that naturally resemble human creations. For example, LLMs from AI21 Labs, Anthropic, Cohere, and Meta are generative AI algorithms that organizations can use to solve complex tasks. Software teams use Amazon Bedrock to deploy these models quickly on the cloud without provisioning servers. 

NLP
Natural language processing (NLP) is a branch of AI that allows computer systems to understand and generate human language. NLP systems use computational linguistics and machine learning technologies to turn language data into simple representations called tokens and understand their contextual relationship. For example, Amazon Lex is an NLP engine that allows organizations to build conversational ai chatbots.  

Computer vision 
Computer vision is a technology that allows systems to extract, analyze, and comprehend spatial information from visual data. Self-driving cars use computer vision models to analyze real-time feeds from cameras and navigate the vehicle safely away from obstacles. Deep learning technologies allow computer vision systems to automate large-scale object recognition, classification, monitoring, and other image-processing tasks. For example, engineers use Amazon Rekognition to automate image analysis for various computer vision applications. 

Robotics
Robotics is an engineering discipline wherein organizations can build mechanical systems that automatically perform physical maneuvers. In AGI, robotics systems allow machine intelligence to manifest physically. It is pivotal for introducing the sensory perception and physical manipulation capabilities that AGI systems require. For example, embedding a robotic arm with AGI may allow the arm to sense, grasp, and peel oranges as humans do. When researching AGI, engineering teams use AWS RoboMaker to simulate robotic systems virtually before assembling them. ",technical,,Artificial Intelligence
"What is artificial general intelligence?
Artificial general intelligence (AGI) is a field of theoretical AI research that attempts to create software with human-like intelligence and the ability to self-teach. The aim is for the software to be able to perform tasks that it is not necessarily trained or developed for. 

Current artificial intelligence (AI) technologies all function within a set of pre-determined parameters. For example, AI models trained in image recognition and generation cannot build websites. AGI is a theoretical pursuit to develop AI systems that possess autonomous self-control, a reasonable degree of self-understanding, and the ability to learn new skills. It can solve complex problems in settings and contexts that were not taught to it at the time of its creation. AGI with human abilities remains a theoretical concept and research goal.

What is the difference between artificial intelligence and artificial general intelligence?
Over the decades, AI researchers have charted several milestones that significantly advanced machine intelligence—even to degrees that mimic human intelligence in specific tasks. For example, AI summarizers use machine learning (ML) models to extract important points from documents and generate an understandable summary. AI is thus a computer science discipline that enables software to solve novel and difficult tasks with human-level performance. 

In contrast, an AGI system can solve problems in various domains, like a human being, without manual intervention. Instead of being limited to a specific scope, AGI can self-teach and solve problems it was never trained for. AGI is thus a theoretical representation of a complete artificial intelligence that solves complex tasks with generalized human cognitive abilities. 

Some computer scientists believe that AGI is a hypothetical computer program with human comprehension and cognitive capabilities. AI systems can learn to handle unfamiliar tasks without additional training in such theories. Alternately, AI systems that we use today require substantial training before they can handle related tasks within the same domain. For example, you must fine-tune a pre-trained large language model (LLM) with medical datasets before it can operate consistently as a medical chatbot. ",technical,,Artificial Intelligence
"Image Processing Techniques and Tools
In image processing, the toolkit includes a range of software and algorithms specifically designed for modifying images. This includes:

"What is Image Processing?
The Art of Beautifying Images
Imagine you have a photograph that isn’t quite perfect – maybe it’s too dark, or the colors are dull. Image processing is like a magic wand that transforms this photo into a better version. It involves altering or improving digital images using various methods and tools. Think of it as editing a photo to make it look more appealing or to highlight certain features. It’s all about changing the image itself.

What is Computer Vision?
Teaching Computers to Interpret Images
Now, imagine a robot looking at the same photograph. Unlike humans, it doesn’t naturally understand what it’s seeing. This is where computer vision comes in. It’s like teaching the robot to recognize and understand the content of the image – is it a picture of a cat, a car, or a tree? Computer vision doesn’t change the image. Instead, it tries to make sense of it, much like how our brain interprets what our eyes see.

Core Principles & Techniques
Computer Vision (CV): Seeing Beyond the Surface
In the realm of Computer Vision, the goal is to teach computers to understand and interpret visual information from the world around them. Let’s explore some of the key principles and techniques that make this possible:

Pattern Recognition
Think of this as teaching a computer to play a game of ‘spot the difference’. By recognizing patterns, computers can identify similarities and differences in images. This skill is crucial for tasks like facial recognition or identifying objects in a scene.

Deep Learning
Deep Learning is like giving a computer a very complex brain that learns from examples. By feeding it thousands, or even millions, of images, a computer learns to identify and understand various elements in these images. This is the backbone of modern computer vision, enabling machines to recognize objects, people, and even emotions.

Object Detection
This is where computers get really smart. Object detection is about identifying specific objects within an image. It’s like teaching a computer to not just see a scene, but to understand what each part of that scene is. For instance, in a street scene, it can distinguish cars, people, trees, and buildings.

Image Processing: Transforming Pixels into Perfection
In the world of Image Processing, the magic lies in altering and enhancing images to make them more useful or visually appealing. Let’s break down some of the fundamental principles and techniques:

Image Enhancement
This is like giving a makeover to an image. Image enhancement can brighten up a dark photo, bring out hidden details, or make colors pop. It’s all about improving the look and feel of an image to make it more pleasing or informative.

Filtering
Imagine sifting through the ‘noise’ to find the real picture. Image filtering involves removing or reducing unwanted elements from an image, like blurring, smoothening rough edges, or sharpening blurry parts. It helps in cleaning up the image to highlight the important features.

Transformation Techniques
This is where an image can take on a new shape or form. Transformation techniques might include resizing an image, rotating it, or even warping it to change perspective. It’s like reshaping the image to fit a specific purpose or requirement.

These techniques form the toolbox of image processing, enabling us to manipulate and enhance images in countless ways.

Distinctions Between Computer Vision and Image Processing
Image Processing: Visual Perfection
The primary aim of image processing is to improve image quality. Whether it’s enhancing contrast, adjusting colors, or smoothing edges, the focus is on making the image more visually appealing or suitable for further use. It’s about transforming the raw image into a refined version of itself.

What is image processing? Image processing is the process of transforming an image into a digital form and performing certain operations to get some useful information from it. The image processing system usually treats all images as 2D signals when applying certain predetermined signal processing methods",technical,,Artificial Intelligence
"Scaling AI infrastructure out and up
To support the growing computational demand of modern workloads, AI clusters must be scaled both out (via network fabrics) and up (within the rack).

Ultra Ethernet addresses the former, providing high-performance, vendor-agnostic links for connecting up to a million nodes within a massive AI network. And UALink addresses the latter, providing high-speed, low-latency links for connecting more than a thousand AI accelerators. 

AI infrastructure Ultra Ethernet UALink
These open, industry-standard protocols make it possible to expand processing performance and scale without vendor lock-in, giving flexibility and investment protection to those building and modernizing hyperscale data centers and high-performance computing (HPC) environments.

As an active member of the Ultra Ethernet Consortium (UEC) and UALink Consortium (UAC), we are helping shape and drive these emerging standards that will spur the next generation of AI and HPC architectures.

The industry’s first Ultra Ethernet and UALink IP solutions
Synopsys is addressing the need for high-bandwidth, low-latency interconnects with the introduction of Ultra Ethernet IP and UALink IP solutions, which provide the interfaces needed to scale today’s and tomorrow’s AI and HPC architectures.

"Boosting Image and Video Inference Efficiency
Unsurprisingly, there are now many purpose-built transformers that support image and video inference with increased accuracy. Meta’s TimeSformer, for example, achieves the best reported numbers on several challenging action recognition benchmarks, including the Kinetics-400 action recognition data set. Moreover, compared with modern 3D CNNs, TimeSformer is approximately three times faster to train and requires less than one-tenth the amount of compute resources for inference. The sheer scalability of TimeSformer enables the training of large models on extended video clips and opens the door for companies to design more intelligent edge AI systems.

Designed for surveillance video anomaly detection (SVAD), TransCNN is a hybrid transformer and CNN mechanism that leverages spatial and temporal information from surveillance videos to detect anomalous events. TransCNN detects anomalies with a high level of accuracy by combining an efficient backbone CNN model for spatial feature extraction with a transformer-based model that learns long-term temporal relationships between different complex surveillance events. TransCNN outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches, achieving high AUC values of 94.6%, 98.4%, and 89.6% on the ShanghaiTech, UCSD Ped2 and CUHK avenue datasets, respectively.

Optimizing AR/VR Applications
Vision transformer models are also helping system designers optimize AR and VR applications. For example, a research team at the University of Science and Technology of China recently combined a transformer-based encoder with a CNN-based decoder to improve conventional depth estimation. Dubbed monocular depth estimation (MDE), the hybrid technique efficiently recovers the depth value of each pixel from a single RGB image. When pitted against NYU Depth V2 (indoor) and KITTI (outdoor) benchmarks, MDE achieves top performance scores on both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

Another team of researchers from Stanford University, NVIDIA, and the University of Hong Kong developed the transformer-based COPILOT to predict and avoid collisions for people immersed in AR and VR environments. To train COPILOT, the research team developed a synthetic data generation framework that generates videos of virtual humans moving and colliding within diverse 3D scenarios. Extensive testing demonstrates COPILOT successfully generalizes unseen synthetic as well as real-world scenes, with outputs that can be harnessed to further improve downstream collision avoidance.

Accelerating Both CNNs and Transformers
Although most current AI accelerators are optimized for CNNs, many of them are not ideal for transformers, as the latter demands considerable compute capabilities and memory resources to perform complex calculations and support sparsity. Optimized for both CNNs and transformers, the ARC  NPX6 NPU IP is an accelerator that efficiently enables high-performance edge AI use cases within a minimal power envelope by:

Integrating hardware and software connectivity features for multiple NPU instances to achieve up to 3,500 tera operations per second (TOPS) of performance on a single SoC
Delivering, in a single instance, up to 250 TOPS at 1.3 GHz on 5nm processes in worst-case conditions, or up to 440 TOPS by using sparsity, which increases performance while decreasing energy demands of executing a neural network
Seamlessly scaling from 4K to 96K multiply–accumulate operations (MACs)
Offering optional 16-bit floating-point support inside the neural processing hardware to maximize layer performance and simplify the transition from GPUs used for AI prototyping to high-volume power- and area-optimized SoCs
The ARC NPX6 NPU IP is paired with the Synopsys ARC® MetaWare MX Development Toolkit which includes compilers and debugger, neural network software development kit (SDK), virtual platforms SDK, runtimes and libraries, and advanced simulation models. To help designers accelerate time to market, the toolkit automatically compiles and optimizes models for CNNs, transformers, recommenders, recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and long short-term memory networks (LSTMs).",technical,,Artificial Intelligence
"AI Transformers + Neural Networks = Amazing Vision Processing
Demand for AI capabilities in a variety of products is growing, and nowhere is this more evident than in computational imaging. The ubiquity of cameras integrated into smartphones (and delivery of high-quality images) has paved the way for cameras to be included in everything from doorbells to medical devices. There are dual branches in computational imaging:

Computational photography, which involves the capture and processing of images using digital computation
And computer vision, which involves the creation of digital systems that can process, analyze, and make sense of visual data as humans can
AI-driven computer vision technology is proving to be essential for delivering accurate, real-time, high-resolution imagery. Traditionally, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were the dominant algorithm in computer vision applications. Neural networks have been commonly used for object detections and are now playing an important role in image quality improvement, taking over tasks that were once done by digital signal processors. For example, because they can embed knowledge of what a good image should look like, neural networks can upscale video streams to 4x the resolution via super resolution networks, and they can be used to reduce noise and enhance low light performance. Features such as blur reduction, high dynamic range, and wide dynamic range are also within the realm of AI-driven computer vision capabilities.

Now, AI transformers—originally developed for natural language processing such as translation and question answering—are emerging as the highest accuracy option. Transformers, based on a self-attention mechanism, are better at learning complex patterns for accurate object detection than CNNs, and therefore can better understand context. Used together with CNNs, the combination of the two deep-learning models can significantly enhance computer vision and image processing accuracy.",technical,,Artificial Intelligence

"If you have a camera and you wanted to detect the movement of an object, how would you track it? Lets take the example of a lightbulb which is a more more straight forward example. First we would need to sample some of the pixels.

Now we don’t want to have to sample every pixel of the screen all of the time when we know the object will likely move a distance relative to its current position. Thus we also need a way to store information on where we found the light bulb — using x and y coordinates.

"Supervised Learning 

bookmark_border
 
Supervised learning's tasks are well-defined and can be applied to a multitude of scenarios—like identifying spam or predicting precipitation.

Foundational supervised learning concepts
Supervised machine learning is based on the following core concepts:

Data
Model
Training
Evaluating
Inference
Data
Data is the driving force of ML. Data comes in the form of words and numbers stored in tables, or as the values of pixels and waveforms captured in images and audio files. We store related data in datasets. For example, we might have a dataset of the following:

Images of cats
Housing prices
Weather information
Datasets are made up of individual examples that contain features and a label. You could think of an example as analogous to a single row in a spreadsheet. Features are the values that a supervised model uses to predict the label. The label is the ""answer,"" or the value we want the model to predict. In a weather model that predicts rainfall, the features could be latitude, longitude, temperature, humidity, cloud coverage, wind direction, and atmospheric pressure. The label would be rainfall amount.

Examples that contain both features and a label are called labeled examples.

Two labeled examples

Placeholder image.

In contrast, unlabeled examples contain features, but no label. After you create a model, the model predicts the label from the features.

Two unlabeled examples

Placeholder image.

Dataset characteristics
A dataset is characterized by its size and diversity. Size indicates the number of examples. Diversity indicates the range those examples cover. Good datasets are both large and highly diverse.

Some datasets are both large and diverse. However, some datasets are large but have low diversity, and some are small but highly diverse. In other words, a large dataset doesn’t guarantee sufficient diversity, and a dataset that is highly diverse doesn't guarantee sufficient examples.

For instance, a dataset might contain 100 years worth of data, but only for the month of July. Using this dataset to predict rainfall in January would produce poor predictions. Conversely, a dataset might cover only a few years but contain every month. This dataset might produce poor predictions because it doesn't contain enough years to account for variability.

Check Your Understanding
What attributes of a dataset would be ideal to use for ML?
Small size / Low diversity
Large size / Low diversity
Small size / High diversity
Large size / High diversity
A dataset can also be characterized by the number of its features. For example, some weather datasets might contain hundreds of features, ranging from satellite imagery to cloud coverage values. Other datasets might contain only three or four features, like humidity, atmospheric pressure, and temperature. Datasets with more features can help a model discover additional patterns and make better predictions. However, datasets with more features don't always produce models that make better predictions because some features might have no causal relationship to the label.

Model
In supervised learning, a model is the complex collection of numbers that define the mathematical relationship from specific input feature patterns to specific output label values. The model discovers these patterns through training.

Training
Before a supervised model can make predictions, it must be trained. To train a model, we give the model a dataset with labeled examples. The model's goal is to work out the best solution for predicting the labels from the features. The model finds the best solution by comparing its predicted value to the label's actual value. Based on the difference between the predicted and actual values—defined as the loss—the model gradually updates its solution. In other words, the model learns the mathematical relationship between the features and the label so that it can make the best predictions on unseen data.

For example, if the model predicted 1.15 inches of rain, but the actual value was .75 inches, the model modifies its solution so its prediction is closer to .75 inches. After the model has looked at each example in the dataset—in some cases, multiple times—it arrives at a solution that makes the best predictions, on average, for each of the examples.

The following demonstrates training a model:

The model takes in a single labeled example and provides a prediction.

An image of a model making a prediction.

Figure 1. An ML model making a prediction from a labeled example.

 

The model compares its predicted value with the actual value and updates its solution.

An image of a model comparing its prediction with actual value.

Figure 2. An ML model updating its predicted value.

 

The model repeats this process for each labeled example in the dataset.

An image of a model repeating the process of its prediction versus the actual value.

Figure 3. An ML model updating its predictions for each labeled example in the training dataset.

 

In this way, the model gradually learns the correct relationship between the features and the label. This gradual understanding is also why large and diverse datasets produce a better model. The model has seen more data with a wider range of values and has refined its understanding of the relationship between the features and the label.

During training, ML practitioners can make subtle adjustments to the configurations and features the model uses to make predictions. For example, certain features have more predictive power than others. Therefore, ML practitioners can select which features the model uses during training. For example, suppose a weather dataset containstime_of_day as a feature. In this case, an ML practitioner can add or remove time_of_day during training to see whether the model makes better predictions with or without it.

Evaluating
We evaluate a trained model to determine how well it learned. When we evaluate a model, we use a labeled dataset, but we only give the model the dataset's features. We then compare the model's predictions to the label's true values.

An image showing a trained model having its predictions compared against actual values.

Figure 4. Evaluating an ML model by comparing its predictions to the actual values.

 

Depending on the model's predictions, we might do more training and evaluating before deploying the model in a real-world application.

Check Your Understanding
Why does a model need to be trained before it can make predictions?
A model needs to be trained to learn the mathematical relationship between the features and the label in a dataset.
A model needs to be trained so it won't require data to make a prediction.
A model doesn't need to be trained. Models are available on most computers.
Inference
Once we're satisfied with the results from evaluating the model, we can use the model to make predictions, called inferences, on unlabeled examples. In the weather app example, we would give the model the current weather conditions—like temperature, atmospheric pressure, and relative humidity—and it would predict the amount of rainfall.",technical,,Artificial Intelligence
"GAN Training 

bookmark_border
 
Because a GAN contains two separately trained networks, its training algorithm must address two complications:

GANs must juggle two different kinds of training (generator and discriminator).
GAN convergence is hard to identify.
Alternating Training
The generator and the discriminator have different training processes. So how do we train the GAN as a whole?

GAN training proceeds in alternating periods:

The discriminator trains for one or more epochs.
The generator trains for one or more epochs.
Repeat steps 1 and 2 to continue to train the generator and discriminator networks.
We keep the generator constant during the discriminator training phase. As discriminator training tries to figure out how to distinguish real data from fake, it has to learn how to recognize the generator's flaws. That's a different problem for a thoroughly trained generator than it is for an untrained generator that produces random output.

Similarly, we keep the discriminator constant during the generator training phase. Otherwise the generator would be trying to hit a moving target and might never converge.

It's this back and forth that allows GANs to tackle otherwise intractable generative problems. We get a toehold in the difficult generative problem by starting with a much simpler classification problem. Conversely, if you can't train a classifier to tell the difference between real and generated data even for the initial random generator output, you can't get the GAN training started.

Convergence
As the generator improves with training, the discriminator performance gets worse because the discriminator can't easily tell the difference between real and fake. If the generator succeeds perfectly, then the discriminator has a 50% accuracy. In effect, the discriminator flips a coin to make its prediction.

This progression poses a problem for convergence of the GAN as a whole: the discriminator feedback gets less meaningful over time. If the GAN continues training past the point when the discriminator is giving completely random feedback, then the generator starts to train on junk feedback, and its own quality may collapse.",technical,,Artificial Intelligence
"A generative adversarial network (GAN) has two parts:

The generator learns to generate plausible data. The generated instances become negative training examples for the discriminator.
The discriminator learns to distinguish the generator's fake data from real data. The discriminator penalizes the generator for producing implausible results.",technical,,Artificial Intelligence
"Extract and Read Data With Pandas
Before data can be analyzed, it must be imported/extracted.

In the example below, we show you how to import data using Pandas in Python.

We use the read_csv() function to import a CSV file with the health data:

Example
import pandas as pd

health_data = pd.read_csv(""data.csv"", header=0, sep="","")

print(health_data)
Example Explained
Import the Pandas library
Name the data frame as health_data.
header=0 means that the headers for the variable names are to be found in the first row (note that 0 means the first row in Python)
sep="","" means that "","" is used as the separator between the values. This is because we are using the file type .csv (comma separated values)
Tip: If you have a large CSV file, you can use the head() function to only show the top 5rows:

Example
import pandas as pd

health_data = pd.read_csv(""data.csv"", header=0, sep="","")

print(health_data.head())
Data Cleaning
Look at the imported data. As you can see, the data are ""dirty"" with wrongly or unregistered values:

Dirty data
There are some blank fields
Average pulse of 9 000 is not possible
9 000 will be treated as non-numeric, because of the space separator
One observation of max pulse is denoted as ""AF"", which does not make sense
So, we must clean the data in order to perform the analysis.

Remove Blank Rows
We see that the non-numeric values (9 000 and AF) are in the same rows with missing values.

Solution: We can remove the rows with missing observations to fix this problem.

When we load a data set using Pandas, all blank cells are automatically converted into ""NaN"" values.

So, removing the NaN cells gives us a clean data set that can be analyzed.

We can use the dropna() function to remove the NaNs. axis=0 means that we want to remove all rows that have a NaN value:

" What is cybersecurity?
Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting critical computers, networks, software applications, systems, and data from potential digital threats. Organizations are responsible for securing data to maintain customer trust and comply with regulatory requirements. They adopt cybersecurity measures and tools to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access, as well as prevent any disruption to business operations due to unwanted network activity. Organizations implement cybersecurity by streamlining digital defense between people, processes, and technologies.

Why is cybersecurity important?
Companies in various sectors, such as energy, transportation, retail, and manufacturing, use digital systems and high-speed connectivity to provide efficient customer service and conduct cost-effective business operations. Just as these organizations secure their physical assets, they must also secure their digital assets and protect their systems from unintended access. The event of a breach and unauthorized access to a computer system, network, or connected facility, if intentional, is called a “cyberattack.” A successful cyberattack results in the disclosure, theft, deletion, or alteration of confidential data. Cybersecurity measures defend against cyberattacks and provide the following benefits:

Prevent breaches or reduce the cost of their consequences
Organizations that implement cybersecurity strategies reduce the unintended consequences of cyberattacks that can affect their reputation, financial position, business operations, and customer trust. For example, companies activate disaster recovery plans to contain potential intrusions and minimize the duration of business disruption.

Ensure regulatory compliance
Companies in specific industries and regions are required to comply with regulatory requirements in order to protect sensitive data from potential cyber risks. For example, companies operating in Europe are required to comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which requires organizations to take appropriate cybersecurity measures to ensure data privacy.

Mitigate evolving cyber threats
As technologies change, new forms of cyberattacks emerge. Criminals use new tools and devise new strategies to gain unauthorized access to a system. Organizations adopt and update cybersecurity measures to keep up with new and evolving digital attack techniques and tools.

What types of attacks does cybersecurity try to defend against?
Cybersecurity professionals seek to contain and mitigate existing and new threats that infiltrate computer systems in a variety of ways. Below are some examples of common cyber threats.

Malware
Malware means malicious software. It includes a set of programs that are created to give third parties unauthorized access to sensitive information or allow them to disrupt the normal operation of critical infrastructure. Common examples of malware include Trojans, spyware, and viruses.

Ransomware
Ransomware refers to a business model and a broad set of related techniques that malicious actors use to extort money from entities. Whether you’re just getting started with AWS or have already begun development, we have resources dedicated to helping you protect your critical systems and sensitive data from ransomware.

Man-in-the-Middle Attack
In a man-in-the-middle attack, an outside party attempts to gain unauthorized access to communications in a network while data is being exchanged. Such attacks increase the security risks of sensitive information, such as financial data.",technical,cybersecurity,
" Phishing
Phishing is a cyber threat that uses social engineering techniques to trick users into revealing personally identifiable information. For example, cyber attackers send emails that lure users into clicking and entering their credit card information on a fake web page to complete a payment. Phishing attacks can also lead to the download of malicious attachments that install malware on company devices.

Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attack
A distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack is a coordinated effort to overwhelm a server by sending a large number of fake requests. Such events prevent normal users from connecting to or accessing the targeted server.

Insider Threat
An insider threat is a security risk caused by individuals with bad intentions within an organization. Employees have high-level access to computer systems and can destabilize the security of the infrastructure from within.

How Does Cybersecurity Work?

Organizations implement cybersecurity strategies by working with cybersecurity professionals. These professionals assess the security risks of existing computing systems, networks, data stores, applications, and other connected devices. Cybersecurity professionals then create a comprehensive cybersecurity framework and implement preventive measures across the organization.

To ensure a successful cybersecurity program, employees must be informed about security best practices and automated cyberdefense techniques must be used in the current IT infrastructure. These elements work together to create multiple layers of protection against potential threats at all points of data access. They identify risks, protect identities, infrastructure, and data, monitor for anomalies and events, respond and analyze the root cause, and recover after the event.

To ensure the success of a cybersecurity program, employees must be informed in its context about security best practices and automated cyber defense techniques must be used in the existing IT infrastructure. These elements work together to create multiple layers of protection against potential threats at all points of data access. They identify risks, protect identities, infrastructure, and data, monitor for anomalies and events, respond and analyze the root cause, and recover after the event occurs.

What are the types of cybersecurity?
An effective cybersecurity approach addresses the following concerns within an organization.

Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity
Critical infrastructure refers to the digital systems that society finds important, such as energy, communications, and transportation. Organizations operating in these areas require a systematic approach to cybersecurity, because a service outage or data loss can destabilize society.

Network Security
Network security is the cybersecurity protection of computers and devices connected to a network. IT teams use network security technologies, such as firewalls and network access control, to regulate user access and manage permissions for specific digital assets.

Cloud Security
Cloud security describes the actions an organization takes to protect data and applications running in the cloud. It is important to build customer trust, ensure fault-tolerant operations, and comply with data privacy regulations in a scalable environment. An effective cloud security strategy involves shared responsibility between the cloud provider and the organization.

IoT Security
The term Internet of Things (IoT) refers to electronic devices that operate remotely over the Internet. For example, a smart alarm clock that sends regular updates to your smartphone is an IoT device. IoT devices introduce an additional layer of security risks due to constant connectivity and hidden software bugs. Therefore, it is essential to implement security policies in the network infrastructure to assess and mitigate the potential risks of different IoT devices.

Data Security
Data security protects data in transit and at rest through efficient storage and secure data transmission. Developers take preventative measures, such as encryption and isolated backups, to ensure operational resilience when dealing with potential data breaches. In some cases, developers use the AWS Nitro System to keep storage private and restrict operator access.

Application Security
Application security is a coordinated effort to improve the protection of applications from unauthorized manipulation attempts at design, development, and testing. Software programmers write secure code to prevent errors that could increase security risks.

Endpoint Security
Endpoint security addresses security risks that arise when users access an organization’s network remotely. Endpoint Security Protection scans files from individual devices and mitigates threats when they are detected.

Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity Planning
This describes contingency plans that allow organizations to respond quickly to cybersecurity incidents and continue operating with little or no disruption. It implements data recovery policies to respond positively to data loss events. Sharing Information with End Users
Individuals within an organization play a critical role in ensuring the success of cybersecurity strategies. Sharing information is key to ensuring that employees are trained in security best practices, such as deleting suspicious emails and refraining from connecting unknown USB devices.

What are the components of a cybersecurity strategy?
A strong cybersecurity strategy requires a coordinated approach that includes the organization’s people, processes, and technologies.

People
Most employees are unaware of the latest threats and security best practices that help protect their devices, networks, and servers. Training and educating employees on cybersecurity principles reduces the risk of oversight that could lead to unwanted incidents.

Process
The IT security team develops a robust security framework to ensure continuous monitoring and reporting of known vulnerabilities in the organization’s computing infrastructure. The framework is a tactical plan that ensures that the organization responds and recovers promptly from potential security incidents.

Technology
Organizations use cybersecurity technologies to protect connected devices, servers, networks, and data from potential threats. For example, companies use firewalls, antivirus, malware detection, and DNS filtering to automatically detect and prevent unauthorized access to internal systems. Some organizations use zero-trust security technologies to further enhance cybersecurity.

What are modern cybersecurity technologies?
These are modern cybersecurity technologies that help organizations secure their data.

Zero trust
Zero trust is a cybersecurity principle that assumes that no applications or users are automatically trusted, even if they are hosted on-premises. Instead, the zero trust model assumes that access control is of least privilege, requiring strict authentication from relevant authorities and continuous monitoring of applications. AWS uses zero trust principles to authenticate and verify every single API request.

Behavioral analytics
Behavioral analytics monitors data transfer from devices and networks to detect suspicious activity and unusual patterns. For example, an IT security team is alerted to a sudden spike in data transfer or suspicious files being downloaded to certain devices.

Intrusion Detection System
Organizations use intrusion detection systems to quickly identify and respond to cyberattacks. Modern security solutions use machine learning and data analytics to detect dormant threats in an organization’s computing infrastructure. The intrusion defense mechanism also establishes a path for data in the event of an incident, helping the security team discover the source of the incident.

Cloud Encryption
Cloud encryption encrypts data before it is stored in cloud databases. This prevents unauthorized parties from misusing the data in potential breaches. Organizations use AWS Encryption Key Management Service (AWS KMS) to control data encryption in AWS workloads.",technical,cybersecurity,
" Cybersecurity: Protecting the Digital World
In today’s era of accelerating technology and digital transformation, cybersecurity has become one of the most important and urgent issues. Cybersecurity represents the fundamental protection of digital systems and networks, as it aims to protect sensitive data and information from unauthorized access and potential cyber attacks.

Cybersecurity requires multi-level strategies that include prevention, detection, and response to potential threats. These strategies range from the use of advanced encryption and software protection techniques to educating users about digital safety practices.

One of the most prominent challenges facing the field of cybersecurity is the rapid growth of cyber threats. Hackers and hackers are constantly inventing new methods to penetrate systems and networks, which requires cybersecurity professionals to stay up to date with the latest developments and cyber threats to implement appropriate protection measures.

Despite the challenges, cybersecurity can be achieved by investing in advanced security technologies, enhancing awareness of digital safety practices, and enhancing cooperation and coordination between stakeholders in institutions and governments.

Ultimately, cybersecurity is a shared responsibility between individuals, organizations, and governments, with collective awareness and action playing a crucial role in addressing cyber challenges and ensuring the safety and security of the modern digital world.",technical,cybersecurity,
" Cybersecurity - also called computer security - is a means of protecting software, computers and networks. It is a set of measures taken to confront cyber attacks and hacks and the resulting dangers. It appeared at the beginning of the Cold War and developed with the Internet revolution and computer systems, and became a basic international security and warfare tool.

A cyber attack poses a security risk to individuals, institutions and countries. It may be used to steal data, fraud, and illegally access confidential financial, medical, military or security data, or even manipulate electronic device systems remotely and direct them with political goals with the intent to cause material damage, such as remotely detonating devices or disabling systems.

Cybersecurity aims to protect 5 types of equipment and basic systems, which are infrastructure security (communications, transportation, energy, etc.), network security, cloud security, Internet of Things security (smart devices connected to the Internet), and application security.

Definition of Cybersecurity
Cybersecurity is a complex concept that carries many meanings and definitions, and despite their differences, they agree on its general function approximately.

According to the International Telecommunication Union, cybersecurity is “a set of security tools, policies, concepts, security precautions, guidelines, risk management approaches, procedures, training, and other practices, assurance mechanisms, and technologies that can be used to protect the cyber environment, the assets of organizations, and users from security risks associated with the cyber environment.” The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) defines it as “the art of protecting networks, devices, and data from unauthorized access or criminal use, and is the practice of ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information.”",technical,cybersecurity,
" Definition of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning in Cybersecurity
Cybersecurity AI, powered by machine learning, is expected to be a powerful tool in the near future. As with other industries, human interaction has always been essential and indispensable in the field of security. While cybersecurity currently relies heavily on human input, are we gradually seeing technology become better than the human factor in certain tasks?

Every technological improvement brings us a little closer to completing human roles more effectively; among these developments, some areas of research are at the core of it all:

AI designed to give computers the full ability to respond to the human mind; this is the comprehensive system that includes many other systems, including machine learning and deep learning.

Machine learning that uses existing behavior patterns and forms a decision-making process based on past data and inferences. Human intervention is still needed for some changes; machine learning is probably the most relevant cybersecurity system to date.
Deep learning works similarly to machine learning by taking decisions from previous patterns but making adjustments on its own. Deep learning in cybersecurity currently falls under the purview of machine learning, so we’ll mostly focus on machine learning here.

What AI and machine learning can do for cybersecurity

AI and cybersecurity have been touted as revolutionary and much closer than we think. However, this is only a partial truth that should be taken with a grain of salt! The truth is that we may see relatively incremental improvements to the future ahead. But in theory, what may seem incremental when compared to a fully autonomous future is still in fact a leap beyond what we have been able to achieve in the past.

As we explore the potential security implications of machine learning and AI, it is important to frame current cybersecurity vulnerabilities; there are many processes and aspects that we have long accepted as business as usual that can be addressed under the umbrella of AI technologies.

Human Error in Configuration
Human error is a significant part of cybersecurity vulnerabilities. For example, it can be extremely difficult to manage proper system configuration, even with large IT teams involved in the setup. In a context of continuous innovation, multi-layered computer security is more prevalent than ever. Response tools can help teams find issues that arise when network systems are replaced, modified, and updated.

Consider how newer Internet infrastructures like cloud computing can be stacked on top of legacy on-premises frameworks. In enterprise systems, IT will need to ensure compliance to secure these systems. Manual processes for assessing configuration security can be overwhelming for teams as they juggle endless updates with mundane day-to-day support tasks. With intelligent, adaptive automation, teams can receive timely advice on newly discovered issues. They can also get advice on follow-up options, or even install systems to automatically adjust settings as needed.

Human efficiency in repetitive activities
Human efficiency is another weak point in the cybersecurity industry as no manual process can be perfectly repeated every time, especially in a dynamic environment like ours. Individually setting up multiple enterprise endpoints is one of the most time-consuming tasks. Even after initial setup, IT teams find themselves reconfiguring the same devices later to correct misconfigurations or outdated settings that cannot be fixed in remote updates.

In addition, when employees are tasked with dealing with threats, the scope of said threat can change quickly. Human focus can be slowed by unforeseen challenges, and AI and machine learning-based systems can move with minimal delay.

Threat Alert Fatigue
Threat alert fatigue in organizations creates another vulnerability if not handled carefully. This increases the attack surface as the above layers of security become more detailed and pervasive. Many security systems are tuned to react to multiple known issues through a barrage of purely reflexive alerts; as a result, these individual prompts leave it to human teams to analyze potential decisions and take action.

The sheer influx of alerts makes this level of decision-making particularly taxing. Ultimately, decision fatigue becomes a daily experience for cybersecurity professionals! Proactively addressing these identified threats and vulnerabilities is ideal, but many teams lack the time and staff to cover all their bases.

Sometimes teams have to decide to address the biggest concerns first and leave the secondary goals aside. Using AI in cybersecurity efforts can allow IT teams to manage more of these threats in an efficient and practical way. Addressing each of these threats can be much easier if they are grouped together via automated tagging. Additionally, some concerns may actually be able to be addressed by the machine learning algorithm itself.

Threat Response Time
Threat response time is one of the most pivotal metrics of a cybersecurity team’s effectiveness. From time to deployment to time to deployment, malicious attacks are known toThe world moves very quickly. Attackers in the past would have to scrutinize network permissions and disable security for weeks at a time before launching their attack.

Unfortunately, cybersecurity experts aren’t the only ones benefiting from technological innovations; automation has since become more common in cyberattacks. Threats like the recent LockBit ransomware attacks have dramatically sped up attack times. Some attacks can now move as quickly as half an hour.

Even with known types of attacks, human response can be delayed from the initial attack. For this reason, many teams have often been involved in reacting to successful attacks rather than preventing attempted attacks. On the other end of the spectrum, undetected attacks pose a risk in their own right.

Machine learning-powered security can pull data from an attack to be instantly aggregated and prepared for analysis; It can provide cybersecurity teams with streamlined reports to facilitate remediation and cleanup decisions. Beyond just reporting, this type of security can also provide recommended action to mitigate further damage and prevent future attacks.

Identifying and predicting new threats
Identifying and predicting new threats is another factor that impacts response timeframes to cyberattacks. As noted earlier, lag time already exists with existing threats. Unknown attack types, behaviors, and tools can trick teams into slower responses. Worse, quieter threats like data theft can sometimes go completely undetected! A Fugue survey in April 2020 found that nearly 84% of IT teams were concerned about cloud-based systems being compromised without their knowledge.

The constant evolution of an attack that leads to attack loopholes without waiting is always a primary concern within network defense efforts. But there is some good news: cyberattacks are not commonly built from scratch; Since they are often built on top of behaviors, frameworks, and source codes from previous attacks, machine learning has a pre-existing pipeline to work from.

Machine learning-based programming can help highlight commonalities between a new threat and previously identified threats to aid in attack detection. This is something that humans cannot do effectively in a timely manner, further highlighting the need for adaptive security models. From this perspective, machine learning can also make it easier for teams to predict new threats and reduce lag time due to increased threat awareness.

Staffing capabilities
Staffing capabilities fall within the scope of ongoing issues that many IT and cybersecurity teams face globally. Depending on the organization’s needs, the number of qualified professionals can be limited.

However, the most common situation is that hiring human help can also cost organizations more than their budget. Supporting human staff requires not only compensating for the day-to-day work, but also providing assistance with their ongoing need for education and certification. Being a cybersecurity professional requires a commitment to innovation, especially as we’ve been talking about it throughout the discussion so far.

AI-based security tools can take the lead and support a less-staffed team. While these employees will need to keep up with the evolving fields of AI and machine learning, the cost and time savings will come with fewer staffing requirements.

Adaptability
Adaptability is not as obvious a concern as any of the other points mentioned, but it can significantly transform an organization’s security capabilities. Human teams may lack the ability to customize their skill sets to your specific requirements.

If employees aren’t trained in specific methods, tools, and systems, you may find that your team’s effectiveness is stunted as a result. Even seemingly simple needs like implementing new security policies can move slowly with human teams. This is just human nature, as we can’t learn new ways of doing things right away and need to have the time to do so. With the right datasets, however, properly trained algorithms can be transformed into a tailored solution specifically for you.",technical,cybersecurity,
" How AI is used in cybersecurity

AI in cybersecurity is a superset of disciplines such as machine learning and deep learning cybersecurity, but it has its own role.

At its core, AI is focused on “success” with “accuracy” coming second; natural responses to problem-solving in detail are the ultimate goal. In a true implementation of AI, actual autonomous decisions are made that are programmed to find the ideal solution in a given situation, rather than simply making hard, logical inferences from a data set.

To further clarify, it is best to understand how modern AI works and its core disciplines currently. Autonomous systems do not fall within the scope of systems that are widely deployed, especially in the field of cybersecurity; these self-directed systems are what many people associate with AI. However, AI systems that assist or enhance our preventive services are practical and accessible.

The ideal role of AI in cybersecurity is to interpret the patterns identified by machine learning algorithms. Of course, it is not yet possible for modern AI to interpret the results with human capabilities. Work is underway to help advance this field in the pursuit of human-like frameworks, but true AI is a distant goal that requires machines to take abstract concepts across situations and reframe them. In other words, this level of creativity and critical thinking is nowhere near as far as the AI ​​rumor mill would have you believe.

How Machine Learning Is Used in Cybersecurity
Machine learning security solutions are different from what people imagine AI to be. However, they are easily the most powerful AI tools for cybersecurity available to us to date. Within this technology, patterns in data are used to detect the likelihood of an event occurring.

Machine learning is somewhat at odds with true AI in some ways: Machine learning is particularly focused on “accuracy,” but it is not focused on “success.” What this means is that machine learning intends to learn from a task-focused dataset and concludes by finding the optimal performance for the given task. It will then pursue the only possible solution based on the data provided, even if it is not the ideal solution. With machine learning, there is no real interpretation of the data, which means that this responsibility still falls to human teams.

Machine learning excels at tedious tasks like identifying and adapting to data patterns; humans are not well-suited to these types of tasks due to task fatigue and a general lack of tolerance for monotony. So while interpreting data analysis is still human-led, machine learning can help contextualize the data into a readable, detailed presentation. Machine learning cybersecurity comes in several different forms, each with its own unique benefits.

Data Classification
Data classification works by using predefined rules to assign categories to data points. Classifying these points is an important part of building a profile of attacks, vulnerabilities, and other aspects of proactive security. This is fundamental to the integration of machine learning and cybersecurity.

Data Clustering
Data clustering takes outliers to classify predefined rules, and places them into “aggregated” groups of data with common characteristics or individual benefits. For example, this can be used when analyzing attack data that the system has not already been trained on. These groups can help determine how an attack occurred, as well as what was accessed and exposed.

Recommended Courses of Action
Recommended courses of action leverage the proactive actions of the machine learning security system; these warnings are based on past behavior patterns and decisions, and provide suggested courses of action naturally. It is important to reiterate here that this is not intelligent decision-making via true autonomous AI. Rather, it is an adaptive inference framework that can access pre-existing data points to draw logical relationships. This type of tool can greatly assist in responding to threats and mitigating risks.

Probability Synthesis
Probability synthesis allows for the synthesis of entirely new possibilities based on lessons from past data and new, unfamiliar datasets. This is slightly different from recommendations, as it focuses more on the likelihood that an action or system state will align with similar past situations. For example, this synthesis can be used to proactively investigate vulnerabilities in enterprise systems.

Predictive Estimation
Predictive estimation is the most forward-thinking process of the machine learning component. This feature is achieved by predicting likely outcomes through the evaluation of existing datasets. This can be used primarily for building threat models, identifying fraud prevention, and protecting against data breaches, and is a key component of many predictive endpoint solutions.",technical,cybersecurity,
" Examples of Machine Learning in Cybersecurity
To illustrate further, here are some examples that highlight the value of machine learning as it relates to cybersecurity:

Data Privacy and Compliance Classification
Protecting your organization from privacy law breaches should be a top priority over the past few years. With the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) leading the way, other legal measures have emerged, such as the California Consumer Protection Act.

Data collected from your customers and users must be managed under these procedures, which typically means that this data must be accessible for deletion upon request. The consequences of not following these regulations include hefty fines, as well as damage to your organization’s reputation.

Data classification can help you separate user-identifiable data from anonymous or de-identified data. This saves you the manual labor of trying to analyze large sets of old and new data, especially in large or legacy organizations.

User Behavior Security Profiles
By creating custom profiles of network employees based on user behaviors, security can be tailored to your organization. This model can then determine what an unauthorized user might look like based on general values ​​of user behavior. Subtle traits such as keystrokes can form a predictive threat model. With an outline of the likely outcomes of potential unauthorized user behaviors, machine learning security can suggest recommended recourse to minimize exposed attack surfaces.

System Performance Security Profiles
Similar to the concept of a user behavior profile, a personalized diagnostic profile can be compiled of a computer’s overall performance when it is healthy. Monitoring processor and memory usage along with traits such as high internet data usage can indicate malicious activity. However, some users may regularly consume large amounts of data through video conferencing or frequent downloads of large media files. By learning what basic system performance generally looks like, it can determine what it shouldn’t look like, similar to the user behavior rules we discussed in an earlier machine learning example.

Behavioral-based bot blocking
Bot activity can be a drain on incoming bandwidth for websites. This is especially true for those who rely on online business traffic, such as those with dedicated e-commerce storefronts and no physical locations. Real users may have a slow experience that results in lost traffic and business opportunities.

By categorizing this activity, machine learning security tools can block botnets, regardless of the tools used, such as VPNs, that can mask their identity. Behavioral data points on malicious actors can help machine learning security tools form predictive models around this behavior and proactively block new web addresses that display this same activity.

The Future of Cybersecurity
Despite all the fruitful dialogue about the future of this form of security, there are still limitations to note:

Machine learning requires data sets, but it can run afoul of data privacy laws. Training software systems requires a lot of data points to build accurate models, which doesn’t mix well with the “right to be forgotten.” Human identifiers for some data can lead to breaches, so potential solutions should be considered. Possible fixes include making it nearly impossible for systems to access the original data once the software has been trained. Data point anonymization is also being considered, but this will need further scrutiny to avoid distorting the logic of the program.

The industry needs more AI and ML cybersecurity experts who are able to work with programming in this domain. Machine learning network security will benefit greatly from staff who can maintain and modify it as needed. However, the global pool of qualified and trained individuals is smaller (less) than the massive global demand for staff who can deliver these solutions.

Human teams will remain essential. Finally, critical thinking and creativity will be vital to decision making. As mentioned earlier, machine learning is not ready or capable of doing either, nor is AI. To continue on this theme, you will need to use these solutions to augment your existing teams.",technical,cybersecurity,

" Cyber ​​attacks and crimes have become increasingly powerful in recent times; therefore, all large and emerging companies and institutions must use the latest cybersecurity technologies.

In the first part of this article, we mentioned the reasons for turning to these technologies, and now we will learn about the most prominent ones.

The top 5 latest cybersecurity technologies:
The cyber war continues in light of the latest technologies available to hack into systems and networks. There have been many cases of attacks on vital infrastructure such as healthcare, water systems, and electricity networks.

On a smaller scale, there has been a surge in ransomware and malware attacks on corporate networks; therefore, the latest cybersecurity technologies must be relied upon to avoid such problems.

1- Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning
Have you ever wondered: How can one apply artificial intelligence to cybersecurity? Well, the application is somewhat similar to the work of two-factor authentication.

Artificial intelligence and deep learning are used to analyze data, such as records, transactions, and communications, in real time to detect threats or unjustified activities.

2- Behavioral analytics
This technology widely targets social media and online advertisements. Interestingly, behavioral analytics is increasingly being explored to develop advanced cybersecurity technologies.

Behavioral analytics helps identify patterns in system and network activities; to detect potential and real cyber threats. For example: an abnormal increase in data transfer from a particular user device can indicate a potential cybersecurity issue.

While behavioral analytics is mostly used for networks, its application in systems and user devices has witnessed a boom.

3- Embedded device authentication
A PIN and password are no longer sufficient to provide guaranteed protection for devices. Embedded authentications are emerging technologies for verifying user identity.

For example: Intel has made a major breakthrough in this area by introducing the sixth generation of vPro chips. These strong user authentication chips are embedded in the device itself.

These chips are designed to revolutionize authentication security, and they use multiple levels and methods of authentication that work together.

4- Blockchain
Blockchain is one of the latest cybersecurity technologies.

Blockchain technology works on the basis of identification between the two parties of a transaction. Similarly, the cybersecurity blockchain works on the fundamentals of a peer-to-peer network.

Moreover, the blockchain creates a network that cannot be penetrated by hackers and is our best bet at the moment to protect data from being hacked.

So using blockchains with artificial intelligence can create a robust verification system to prevent potential cyber threats.

5- Zero Trust Model
As the name itself suggests, this cybersecurity model is based on the assumption that the network has already been compromised; therefore, the user needs to strengthen both the internal and external networks.

The key point here is that both the internal and external networks need equal protection. This includes: identifying business-critical data, mapping the flow of this data, logical and physical segmentation, control through automation and continuous monitoring.

" Cybersecurity techniques have become increasingly important in today’s information age, where almost everything we do revolves around the use of computers and the Internet.

It is worth noting that the risks involved in managing information are not new, but the Internet has greatly increased the opportunities and threats that companies face, and opened up new horizons for fraud and theft.

In order to protect your company’s data, you need to know the common cyber attacks that exist and how to stop them before they can cause any damage. Therefore, the following 6 cybersecurity techniques will help you manage risks in the information age.

What is Cyber ​​Security?

Cybersecurity is concerned with protecting information systems, computers, and data from malicious cyber attacks.

Cybersecurity must be present in companies, to prevent their data and networks from being hacked, and this responsibility falls on the company’s leader. If he does not have sufficient experience in leading the company and protecting it from cyber threats, the company is in imminent danger, and you can learn the basics of leadership through leadership and management training courses in Dubai.

Cybersecurity is divided into several areas, including:

- Network Security

It is one of the most important categories of cybersecurity, as it provides security for computer networks from hackers.

- Information Security

Cybersecurity works to provide protection for private data against electronic threats, such as malware.

- Application Security

Applications and programs are protected from any threat aimed at hacking their data. This depends on the success of the data designed to protect the application.|

In general, cybersecurity provides security precautions in application of electronic security in any field that enters the Internet.

What are the methods and techniques of cyberattack and hacking?

Information Theft

Information is stolen using email, as messages are sent through it within messages from a trusted source as a camouflage, with the aim of stealing important data, and these attacks have become more widespread.

Ransomware

It is one of the most dangerous technologies, as ransomware programs are designed to obtain money in an extortionate manner, by hacking into device data and systems, and preventing access to them unless money is paid, however; There is no guarantee that data will be recovered, even if money is paid, and this is one of the biggest risks that threaten the data of systems and devices.

Social engineering

It is a hacking method, which is done by clicking on malicious links or sources, or downloading malicious applications, which enables the attacker to hack the device system, and access sensitive data stored on your device.

Usually, a luring method is used until the user clicks on the link or downloads the application.

But how can systems and devices be protected from all these risks! The answer is through cybersecurity techniques that we will talk about below.

The most important cybersecurity techniques

All systems and networks in the world are exposed to hacking by professional hackers and cyber attacks, and this requires measures to confront cyber hacking operations, and protect data, systems, and networks.

The biggest risk that companies face is not only from the actor, but also from the parties supporting them, which usually target specific companies and institutions.

Therefore; The cybersecurity system of institutions must be supported and enhanced, and the cybersecurity capacity of companies must be increased. It is also necessary to delve deeply into the field of cybersecurity to protect networks and related data. The following are some tools and techniques for cybersecurity:

1- Anti-malware programs

There are many forms of malware that hackers use in their cyber attacks to hack devices and networks and spread within them.

Including viruses, spyware, and many others, but anti-malware programs help identify and combat these dangerous programs, and may also work to limit the damage to networks when accessed.

2- Restricting access

If the attacker is unable to access the network, the damage will not be significant, and any person authorized to access the network may also pose a risk, so it is better to restrict user and resource access to the network, and here you have increased the security rate of the network, which is your responsibility.

3- DLP Technology

This technology helps in the proper use of important data, which may be misused by the employee, which exposes it to great danger, so it is important to rely on DPL technologies and policies to get rid of this weak point in use, and this is what you will learn about when studying the basics of data analysis and storage.

4- Endpoint Security

Unfortunately, there is no longer a difference between personal computers and devices used in business, and this has increased the possibility of hacking attacks on personal devices, due to the lack of distinction between them, because the attacker may hack your personal computer, thinking that it is a business computer, so; There must be protection that helps distinguish between the two, and this is what endpoint security does.

5- Intrusion Prevention Systems

These systems monitor network traffic, identify many types of cyber attacks, and repel and combat them, relying on a database of known attack methods.

6- Web Security

Web security protects the network comprehensively, and companies rely on it to add security when using the internal network of the web, and this helps prevent the use of web pages as a way to hack the network.

These were the best practices and technologies in the field of cybersecurity, most of which work according to the artificial intelligence system, thus helping organizations detect and prevent hacking operations Networks are hacked and operational digital information is stolen.",technical,cybersecurity,
" Cybersecurity is the discipline of defending devices and services from cyber attacks by bad actors such as hackers, spammers, and cybercriminals. While some components of cybersecurity aim to attack first, most professionals today are more focused on determining how best to defend all assets, from computers and smartphones to networks and databases, from attacks.

The term cybersecurity has been used as a catch-all phrase in the media to describe the process of protecting against every form of cybercrime, from identity theft to international digital weapons. These labels are accurate, but they fail to convey the true nature of cybersecurity to those without a computer science degree or experience in the digital industry. For a deeper understanding and practical skills, it is advisable to enroll in online cybersecurity courses, designed to make the complexities of cybersecurity accessible to everyone.

Cisco, the technology company specializing in networking, cloud, and security, defines cybersecurity as “the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. These attacks typically aim to access, alter, or destroy sensitive information; extort money from users; or disrupt normal business operations.”

The term “cybersecurity” applies in a variety of contexts, from business to mobile computing, and can be broken down into several common categories.

-Network security: The practice of securing a computer network from intruders, whether targeted attackers or accidental malware.

-Application security: Focuses on keeping software and hardware free from threats. A compromised application can provide access to the data it was designed to protect. Successful security begins at the design stage, before the software or hardware is deployed.

-Information security: Protects the integrity and privacy of data, whether in storage or in transit.

-Operation security: Includes the processes and decisions related to handling and protecting data assets. It includes the permissions users have when accessing the network and the procedures that determine how and where data can be stored or shared.

Disaster recovery and business continuity define how an organization responds to a cyber incident or other event that causes the loss of operations or data. Disaster recovery policies define how an organization restores its operations and information to the same operational capacity as before the event. Business continuity is the plan an organization relies on while trying to operate without certain resources.

End-user education addresses the most unexpected factor in cybersecurity: people. Anyone can introduce a virus into a secure system simply by failing to follow good security practices. Teaching users how to delete suspicious email attachments, not to communicate known threats, and many other important lessons is vital to the security of any organization.

Why is cybersecurity important?

In today’s digital world, cybersecurity cannot be ignored. A single security breach can expose the personal information of millions of people. These breaches have a significant financial impact on businesses and also lead to a loss of customer trust. Therefore, cybersecurity is essential to protect businesses and individuals from spammers and cybercriminals. Everyone benefits from advanced cybersecurity technologies. On a personal level, a cyberattack can lead to problems such as identity theft, extortion attempts, or the loss of important data such as family photos. Everyone relies on critical infrastructure such as power plants, hospitals, and financial services companies, so securing these institutions is essential to ensuring the continuity of society.

Everyone also benefits from the efforts of cybersecurity researchers, such as the 250-strong Talos team, who investigate new threats and strategies. They uncover new vulnerabilities, educate the public about the importance of cybersecurity, and work to improve open source tools. Their efforts help make the Internet a safer place for everyone.

How does cybersecurity work?
Cybersecurity includes the techniques, processes, and methods of defending computer systems, data, and networks from attacks. To better answer the question “what is cybersecurity” and how it works, we need to break it down into a number of sub-areas:

Application Security

Application security covers the implementation of various defenses in software and services within an organization against a variety of threats. This area requires cybersecurity professionals to write secure code, design secure application architectures, implement robust data entry validation mechanisms, and more, to reduce the chance of unauthorized access or modification of application resources.

Identity Management and Data Security

This area covers the activities, frameworks, and processes that enable the authorization and verification of the identity of legitimate individuals to access an organization’s information systems. These measures include implementing robust information storage mechanisms that secure data, whether in transit or stored on a server or computer. Additionally, this area makes greater use of authentication protocols, whether two-factor or multi-factor.

Mobile Security

Mobile security is important today as more and more people rely on mobile devices. This field aims to protect organizational and personal information stored on mobile devices such as tablets, mobile phones, and laptops from various threats such as unauthorized access, loss or theft of devices, malware, viruses, and others. In additionAdditionally, mobile security uses authentication and education to enhance security.

Information Security Locally

The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia ranked second globally in the Cybersecurity Index in the 2022 World Competitiveness Yearbook Report issued by the World Competitiveness Center of the International Institute for Management Development in Switzerland (IMD), reflecting the Kingdom's keenness to support cybersecurity through efforts that included implementing about 45 cyber exercises, empowering more than 4,000 cybersecurity specialists, raising the level of cyber awareness for more than 7,200 beneficiaries in various agencies, and implementing initiatives aimed at enhancing the competitiveness of national cadres specialized in the field.

The percentage of spending on cybersecurity in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is estimated at about 7% of the total spending on the information technology sector in the Kingdom, which exceeds the global rate estimated at 5%. The growth rate in spending on cybersecurity in the Kingdom is 13.7% compared to 10.9% globally and 5% in the Arab world. The global cybersecurity industry market is expected to record $326 billion by 2027 according to Grand View Research estimates, with an annual growth rate estimated at 10% starting in 2020. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is working to take many measures to support information security and cybersecurity intensively. The most prominent of these efforts is the launch of the National Cybersecurity Strategy, which aims, according to its slogan, “A secure and reliable Saudi cyberspace that enables growth and prosperity.” This is achieved through 6 main axes: integration, organization, assurance, defense, cooperation, and construction, through covering the controls of the National Cybersecurity Authority, which reach 114 basic controls distributed over some targets, namely governance, strengthening and resilience of cybersecurity, the relationship of cybersecurity with external parties, cloud computing, and industrial control systems.

The interest in cloud computing increases the motivations for enhancing cybersecurity due to its importance to this technology, as it provides protection from cyber attacks on cloud solutions, support for service providers and subscribers, and guarantees the protection, safety, confidentiality, and availability of information, protection of systems and information processing devices, and security management of",technical,cybersecurity,
" What is Cybersecurity?

Definition of the concept
Cyber ​​Security
Cyber ​​Security is clear from analyzing the term itself, as the term consists of two words:

Security means protection and insurance
and Cyber ​​means electronic or online.

Accordingly, cyber security means securing electronic devices and providing security for Internet networks and software systems and protecting important digital data from any electronic threats or dangers that lead to
hacking
and destabilizing them.

Cybersecurity is originally concerned with repelling electronic attacks and securing electronic systems and devices. This security occurs by providing multiple layers of protection distributed over systems and networks with specific methodologies so that they cannot be hacked, and then sensitive data is saved, and the course of commercial and other interactions is secured through cyberspace to ensure that they run smoothly and securely.

Cybersecurity in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
Cybersecurity in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia receives special attention, as the Kingdom is making tangible and diligent efforts to provide a secure environment for data and to run digital operations smoothly and securely. This comes in light of the Kingdom's focus on the success of Vision 2030, a vision whose goals include making great strides in digital transformation in the country.

From this standpoint, relevant authorities such as the National Cybersecurity Authority have put in place controls, programs, legislation, frameworks and measures aimed at protecting data and information and protecting the public interest. The impact of these steps has already been evident in the Kingdom's ranking second globally out of 193 countries, and its ranking first in the Arab world, the Middle East and Asia in the Global Cybersecurity Index, issued by the United Nations agency specialized in information and communications technology.

How does cybersecurity work?
Cybersecurity works through an organized process that consists primarily of 3 aspects: prevention, monitoring and deterrence, through which it aims to protect systems, networks and digital data from unauthorized access, theft or damage.

1. Prevention
The prevention aspect includes the strategic implementation of security measures that aim to proactively avoid unauthorized access and thwart potential breaches. This proactive stance is crucial to creating a fortified digital environment that acts as a deterrent against malicious actors seeking to exploit vulnerabilities.

2. Monitoring
Monitoring plays a pivotal role in cybersecurity, identifying potential threats and vulnerabilities within a system. This involves using advanced monitoring tools, intrusion detection systems, and other sophisticated technologies to examine network traffic and system behavior. Timely and accurate monitoring is essential to staying one step ahead of potential security breaches, allowing for quick and effective measures to be implemented.

3. Repel
Repel is the third aspect of cybersecurity, which entails taking the necessary actions to contain a security breach. The speed with which these actions are taken when a breach occurs is critical. This includes quickly isolating the systems affected by the breach, neutralizing the threats, recovering the compromised data, and implementing corrective actions to fortify the system so that such breaches do not recur.

What are the responsibilities of a cybersecurity professional?
The responsibilities of a cybersecurity specialist revolve around providing comprehensive security for the electronic system, as new security threats emerge all the time, and cybersecurity specialists must follow up on all new developments in the methods used by hackers in this field, especially since statistics indicate that the global economy will incur about 10.5 trillion dollars by 2025. We will mention below what a cybersecurity employee does and the most important responsibilities entrusted to him:

Setting controls on user access to the system or network according to the necessary security standards.
Monitoring the performance of the network and systems to detect security vulnerabilities and any suspicious activity.
Conducting regular audits to ensure that the security system is running smoothly.
Continuously updating the organization's security policies and protection measures.
Implementing measures against breaches when a cyberattack is detected.
Tracking developments and updates Staying informed of the latest tricks used to preempt any potential attack.
Educating the organization's employees about cybersecurity risks and how to confront them and providing them with the necessary basics.
What is the importance of cybersecurity?
The importance of cybersecurity is evident in the benefits it provides to both organizations and individuals, but here we will focus on the importance of cybersecurity for organizations in particular.

The benefits of cybersecurity are evident when we look at the statistics that show the significant increase in the frequency of cyberattacks, their increasing complexity, and their negative effects. According to reports, cyberattack rates doubled at the beginning of 2020 by 300%. This coincided with companies moving to work online in light of the social distancing measures imposed by the Covid-19 pandemic, so hackers took advantage of the lack of a strong cybersecurity structure for these companies and doubled their attacks.

Our interest in this topic at Zaman comes as a result of the increasing need to enhance cybersecurity in the world and in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in particular, as a result of the massive digital transformation process that the Kingdom aims to achieve. It was necessary to deter data theft and provide the necessary security for the virtual environment to flourish, which is not an easy process in light of what studies prove that the global economy incurs losses amounting to a trillion dollars annually due to cyber attacks.

What is the importance of cybersecurity?
The importance of cybersecurity for institutions
The importance of cybersecurity for institutions and companies is evident in protecting important data, sustaining the flow of business operations, and complying with  Regulatory compliance, customer confidence, and staying ahead of the competition. We will discuss each of these points separately below:

1. Protecting critical data
Protecting critical data is one of the main reasons why organizations and companies invest in cybersecurity. This includes protecting customer information, financial records, and intellectual property. A cyberattack that results in a data breach can have serious consequences, including financial losses and damage to an organization’s reputation.

2. Sustaining operations
Sustaining operations means responding to any cyberattack that could disrupt an organization’s operations, causing paralysis and bleeding productivity. Arming your organization with a strong cybersecurity strategy will keep your operations running and reduce the likelihood of costly downtime.

3. Complying with regulations
Complying with country regulations can save your organization from heavy penalties and fines. The organization is subject to a set of regulations that require it to maintain specific controls to protect its customers’ data, such as the cybersecurity legislation and regulations imposed by the National Cybersecurity Authority in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

Zamen

4. Enhancing customer confidence
Enhancing customer confidence is one of the positive effects that come to you from enhancing cybersecurity in your organization, as customers have become more and more aware of the importance of protecting their data, and by demonstrating a strong commitment to cybersecurity, the organization can enhance the trust of its customers in it, which leads to increased loyalty and long-term relationships.

5. Staying ahead of the competition
Staying ahead of the competition is another positive effect that comes to your organization from enhancing cybersecurity, as organizations that prioritize cybersecurity are in a better position to stay ahead of their competitors in the market. Also, by implementing strong security measures, organizations can reduce the risk of cyber threats and focus on their core competencies, which provides them with a competitive advantage.

What are the areas of cybersecurity?
What are the areas of cybersecurity?
Cybersecurity areas vary according to many factors, as there is no single solution that can be applied to different devices, networks and systems to ensure their security. Below we review the types of cybersecurity, covering infrastructure security, network security, endpoint security, application security, cloud security, information security, and mobile security.

1. Critical infrastructure security
Critical infrastructure security protects computer systems, applications, networks, data and assets from
digital products
that society relies on to ensure national security and public interest, such as transportation, communications and energy, as organizations in these areas rely on specific frameworks in cybersecurity, because the disruption of these services or the corruption of data can destabilize society.

2. Network security
Network security prevents unauthorized access to network resources by detecting and intercepting cyber attacks and breaches to prevent users' private information from being changed, stolen or damaged. At the same time, it allows authorized users to securely access network resources by controlling logins, password auditing and other access permissions.

3. Endpoint security
Endpoint security is concerned with protecting devices and their users from attacks, and also protects the network from hackers who take advantage of those endpoints to launch attacks. Endpoints are servers, desktops, laptops and phones, i.e. devices in the hands of users.

4. Application security
Application security protects applications during their design and after launch stages, prevents unauthorized access to and use of applications and related data, and closes loopholes that hackers can exploit.

5. Cloud security
Cloud security secures an organization’s cloud services. In general, cloud security operates on a shared responsibility model: the cloud provider is responsible for securing its services and cloud infrastructure, while the customer is responsible for protecting its data.

6. Information security
Information security is about protecting all of an organization’s important information – digital files and data, documents, and media – against unauthorized access, disclosure, unauthorized use, or alteration.

7. Mobile security
Mobile security includes a set of standards and technologies for smartphones and mobile devices, and more recently, mobile security has come under the umbrella of Unified Endpoint Management (UEM) solutions.

What are the types of cybersecurity threats?
The different types of cybersecurity threats pose a significant risk to organizations and businesses, and understanding these types of threats is essential to protecting your organization. We will cover the most common types of these threats, including malware, ransomware, phishing, and insider threats.

1. Malware
Malware is any piece of software that is intended to cause harm to a computer system, and the vast majority of modern cyber attacks involve some form of malware, which is Hackers infiltrate by creating malware and using it to gain unauthorized access to, disable, or destroy computer systems and sensitive data.

2. Ransomware
Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts a victim’s data or device and threatens to keep it encrypted—or corrupt and erase it—unless the victim pays a ransom to the extortionist. According to statistics, ransomware attacks accounted for
17%
of all cyberattacks launched in 2022.

3. Phishing
Phishing attacks are emails, text messages, or voice messages that attempt to trick users into downloading malware, sharing sensitive information, or transferring money to scammers. The most common are mass phishing attacks—fraudulent emails sent in bulk and disguised as large, trusted brands, asking people to reset their passwords or re-enter credit card information.

4. Insider Threats

Inside threats are caused by bad actors inside the organization itself, or by hackers taking over their accounts. Insider threats can be more difficult to detect than external threats because their activity is authorized, and because they are invisible to antivirus, firewalls, and other security solutions that aim to prevent external attacks.

5. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attack
A distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack aims to disrupt a server, website, or network by overwhelming it with too many simultaneous visits, which leads to service disruption and blocking users from accessing the site or network. Rates of this type of attack have increased significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic, and are often associated with ransomware attacks.

What are the components of a cybersecurity strategy?
There are key components to a cybersecurity strategy, and every company and organization must consider these elements to protect their digital assets, maintain customer trust, and comply with regulations. The most important components of this include assessing risks, developing security policies and procedures, implementing strong security measures for networks and endpoints, establishing strict access controls, encrypting sensitive data, and developing an emergency response plan.

What are the components of a cybersecurity strategy?

1. Risk assessment
Assessing the risks facing your organization provides you with an understanding that is the foundation for developing a strong cybersecurity strategy. Conduct a comprehensive risk assessment to identify potential threats, vulnerabilities, and potential impacts to your organization. This will help you prioritize your efforts and allocate resources effectively.

2. Develop security policies and procedures
It is important to have clear and comprehensive security policies and procedures that define employee roles and responsibilities, define acceptable use of technology, and the steps to take in the event of a security breach. Review and update these policies regularly to keep pace with changes in the technology landscape and emerging threats.

3. Implement strong security measures for networks and endpoints
It is essential to implement strong security measures for networks and endpoints, including firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems, anti-malware software, and secure network access. Update and patch software regularly to address identified vulnerabilities.

4. Establish access controls
Strong access controls should be in place to control user access to sensitive data and systems. Set tight access controls for each user category in the system, implement strong authentication, and continually audit user privileges to mitigate the risk of unauthorized access.

5. Encrypt data
Sensitive data should be encrypted at storage and in transit to protect it from unauthorized users and to avoid potential security breaches and hacks. Encryption adds another layer of security, making it more difficult for hackers and attackers to access sensitive information.

6. Prepare an emergency response plan
A detailed emergency response plan must be prepared to identify the steps, procedures, and measures that will be taken in the event of a security breach. This plan should include communication protocols, define clear roles and responsibilities, and clarify effective guidelines for addressing, containing, overcoming, and recovering from the situation.

What are the most important modern cybersecurity technologies?
It is essential to stay aware of the most important modern cybersecurity technologies in order to address emerging threats in effective ways and provide real protection for sensitive data. Therefore, we will review below 5 of the most important modern technologies used in the field of cybersecurity, which are artificial intelligence, behavioral analytics, the zero-trust model, blockchain technology, and computational encryption.

1. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Deep Learning
Artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning are currently revolutionizing the field of cybersecurity, as these technologies analyze huge amounts of data, learn from patterns, and predict potential threats. By using these technologies, cybersecurity experts can identify and respond to threats faster and more accurately than ever before.

2. Behavioral Analytics
Behavioral analytics is a new cybersecurity technology that uses machine learning algorithms to analyze user behavior. This technology can detect patterns in the way users interact with devices, such as typing speed, mouse movement, and navigation style. By analyzing these patterns, potential threats, such as hackers who have gained access to a user’s account, can be identified.

3. Zero-Trust Model
The Zero-Trust Model is a security model It requires strict verification of the identity of every person or device trying to access an organization’s network, system, and resources. This model assumes that no one is always trusted, even if they are already within the organization’s network perimeter. The zero-trust model has gained momentum in recent years due to the increasing number of cyberattacks targeting businesses and organizations.

4. Blockchain Technology
Blockchain technology is closely associated with cryptocurrencies, but it can also have a powerful impact on the field of cybersecurity. By creating a decentralized database, this technology can provide secure storage of sensitive information and create a near-impenetrable network that repels hackers. It is our best bet at present to protect data from any breach, and its effectiveness is doubled when combined with artificial intelligence technologies.

5. Cloud Encryption
Cloud encryption comes in line with cloud computing becoming an essential part of many organizations and companies. This technology is based on encrypting data before it is stored in cloud databases, preventing hackers from accessing sensitive information.

" Geopolitical tensions and the volatile security situation across the Middle East are increasing the risk of cyber threats, which is likely to increase spending on cybersecurity to more than $6.5 billion this year, which is higher than spending in previous years. Studies indicate that the cybersecurity market in the Middle East, Africa and Turkey is growing, and spending on cybersecurity services is also increasing. Compared to other countries in the world, this region is considered one of the most vulnerable to attacks due to its geographical location and strategic importance for major investing companies. The cybersecurity market in the Middle East is expected to reach $44.7 billion by 2027.

Not only that, but the interest in achieving comprehensive digital transformation and transferring operations to cloud computing has put companies at constant risk, requiring them to constantly monitor their data and ensure the safety of their network to confront hackers. Countries in the region are divided between those that spend heavily on technology solutions and cybersecurity plans, and those that ignore this issue due to limited capital or other logistical and technical reasons.

Investing in cybersecurity and increasing competition

Advanced countries enjoy greater security services with increased internet connectivity. Compared to other countries in the region, the Gulf countries are improving their cybersecurity posture with increased investments in integration services and managed security services. The UAE, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman and Bahrain excel in cybersecurity with their leadership in the technology and technology sector and their continuous support for AI innovations and everything related to technology.

With its strong infrastructure, the UAE has a distinct digital identity that enables it to provide the best services and adopt technology for multiple uses in the public and private sectors. The use of AI enables companies in the UAE to access super-fast speeds in addition to developing operating systems and electronic work standards and expanding the scope of digital services. In 2020, the UAE ranked fifth in the Cybersecurity Index with an improved level of awareness about the importance of digital security and protecting information on the Internet. In the context of the state's efforts to enhance its cybersecurity, the UAE highlights its cybersecurity strategy, confirming the state's position in supporting innovation and comprehensive digital transformation and protecting citizens from potential risks.

For its part, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is interested in activating the cybersecurity policy, as it has the largest telecommunications and technology market in the Middle East. Given the importance of digital protection and the threats that the Kingdom has been exposed to in recent years, it was necessary to activate the role of the National Cybersecurity Authority, which aims to support the digital infrastructure, manage cyberattacks and work to reduce them, and try to build a safe digital environment that responds to the Kingdom's Vision 2030. These efforts were reflected in the position of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in the Cybersecurity Index, where it ranked second in the index for the year 2023. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is carrying out several collaborations to provide the highest level of digital services and security to users, in addition to providing training courses and organizing workshops that enable the emergence of greater skills in cybersecurity and bridging the digital gap.

Qatar is also entering the competition with its growing spending on cybersecurity, which could exceed $1.64 billion by 2026. Qatar is showing a remarkable trend towards digital solutions with the adoption of technology, the entry of the Internet into all sectors, and work on digitizing services and benefiting from the era of artificial intelligence, which includes the growth of Internet of Things technology, cloud computing, data analysis, and others.

After entering the world of cybersecurity in 2017, the State of Kuwait is making progress in this field, which represents a necessity to protect sensitive information and data. Today, Kuwait is adopting a set of strategies and policies that serve this goal to confront the challenges of cybersecurity.

The entire region is dealing with the new, rapidly changing digital environment, starting from integrating artificial intelligence into industrial and operational processes, to enhancing the self-capabilities of digital protection and all threats related to this framework.

Digital security amidst the expansion of artificial intelligence

Artificial intelligence imposes a new reality that cannot be overlooked, prompting companies and individuals to take greater measures to respond to the increase in attacks and fraudulent operations resulting from emerging innovations supported by artificial intelligence and other technologies. According to studies, the spread and expansion of artificial intelligence is expected to be the reason for increasing cybersecurity resources by 2025, which entails determining a greater value for spending on protecting applications and websites.

Technology experts and cybersecurity leaders express their concerns about the risks of artificial intelligence and the possibility of skills, applications and smart programs not being equal to this rapid growth. As governments respond to the transformations, they must now double their strength with the use of more developed, advanced and protected models to achieve a balance between artificial intelligence services and digital security without hacking individuals’ data or violating the business sector.

In this regard, recent studies show the interest of the Middle East and Africa region in how to manage potential digital risks and address all issues related to artificial intelligence, and the region’s spending on this has grown by 12.1% during the current year, reaching $3.3 billion as a step to confront cyberattacks.

Who is behind cyberattacks around the world?

There are many parties and countries behind cyberattacks, but the result is the same, as these represent Operations pose the greatest threat to users' activity on the Internet. The responsibility for cyber attacks (occurring between 2000 and 2023) is distributed among several countries around the world, but 46.8% of them remain unknown. While the countries responsible for these attacks are distributed between 11.7% from Russia, 11.1% from China, 5.3% from Iran, 4.4% from North Korea, 2.5% from Ukraine, 2.3% from America, 1.7% from Turkey, 1.6% from Pakistan and 12.6% from other countries. Developing countries are demonstrating their strength in breaching electronic systems and accessing sensitive information, which threatens national security and the privacy of individuals. Experts expect that cyber operations in the future will take on a destructive nature and will continue at an increasing pace as long as activity on the Internet is intense, as hackers exploit existing technical vulnerabilities to reach the target without exception.",technical,cybersecurity,
" Current and emerging technology trends dominated discussions at the first meeting of the G20 Digital Economy Task Force, held this week in Riyadh. The meeting discussed a number of topics related to the two pillars of the Saudi G20 Presidency: Empowering People and Shaping New Frontiers.

" What is cybersecurity?
Cybersecurity is the process of protecting systems, data, communications, and networks that are connected to the Internet from digital attacks. These attacks, commonly referred to as ""cyber attacks,"" are attempts to penetrate, modify, disrupt, enter, or use something unlawfully; therefore, cyber attacks can range from installing malicious code on a personal computer to attempting to destroy the infrastructure of entire countries.

In brief, the term refers to a virtual domain created by interconnected computers and computer networks on the Internet, and simply put: it is the medium in which all computer networks exist and through which electronic communication occurs.

cyberwiser
Cyberspace:
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) defines cyberspace as a global domain within the information environment consisting of an independent network of information systems infrastructures, including the Internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, processors, and embedded controllers.

In short, the term refers to a virtual domain created by interconnected computers and computer networks on the Internet, and simply put: it is the medium in which all computer networks exist and through which electronic communication occurs.

Difference between Information Assurance / Information Security and Cyber ​​Security:
What is Information Security and Cyber ​​Security? We often hear these terms in job advertisements or media channels, but what is the fundamental difference between them?

Both terms “cybersecurity and information security” refer to the protection of computer systems and are often used interchangeably. For those who are not familiar with the difference, the definitions and interpretations of the terms differ greatly and should not be used interchangeably, as is often the case.

Cybersecurity, as defined by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, is “the ability to protect or defend against cyber attacks when using cyberspace.” Simply put, cybersecurity is concerned with threats from internal or external actors, or limited to the vulnerabilities of the device used by an individual, and thus, protecting devices, networks, servers, and applications connected to or on the Internet that are vulnerable to hacking, targeted attacks, or unauthorized access.

“Information assurance and security” relates to the process of managing risks related to the use, storage, and transmission of data and information systems. This will include plans or policies with a broader focus to ensure the functionality of data or information systems (known as the five pillars of information assurance). For example, protecting digital and non-digital information assets, such as hard copy records.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in its glossary of key information security terms provides definitions for both “information assurance” and “information security”:

Information assurance:
The measures that protect and defend information and information systems to ensure their availability, integrity, authentication, confidentiality, and inviolability. These measures include providing information system recovery through the integration of protection, detection, and reaction capabilities.

Information protection (or information security as defined by the National Institute of Standards and Technology):
The protection of information and information technology systems from any breach, disruption, modification, unauthorized access, or use or exploitation to provide

Information integrity:
The integrity of information from destruction, including ensuring the integrity and authenticity of information.

Information confidentiality:
The maintenance of authorized restrictions on access and disclosure, including means of protecting personal privacy and proprietary information.

Information availability:
The assurance of reliable and timely access to information and its use when needed.

Information security employs security solutions, encryption, and other technologies, as well as policies and procedures to ensure the security of information, and can be considered a subspecialty or component of information assurance. While both share a common goal of maintaining the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of information, information assurance is typically a broader strategic initiative consisting of a broad set of information protection and management measures.

Cybercrime and Cyberattack in the Context of Cybersecurity
The execution of a “cyberattack” is considered to be the result of an “intentional act” for this purpose, where the concept of this term should be linked to the behavior or result of the occurrence of the act of cybercrime. This crime has become a transnational and cross-border organization, and threatens a large segment of the world’s population, because perpetrators resort to multiple and diverse means when carrying it out.

Cybercrime is generally understood as “the use of a means based on the use of computers to commit an illegal act. One typical definition describes cybercrime as “any crime facilitated or committed by using a computer, network or other device to disclose or seize information or to disrupt or gain access to devices or networks without legal justification. As such, it covers a wide range of illegal activities.”

Traditionally, cybercrime has generally been understood to be carried out by individuals rather than states. This understanding has changed subjectively as we have not only seen threats in the form of financially motivated or information extortion campaigns by cybercriminals, but the identities of individuals from these groups being attacked for geopolitical reasons. While the distinction between cybercrime and cyberattack is crucial, we recognize that it is often difficult to know whether a cyber event is one or the other (or both), at the time of the event – ​​in part because the identity of the perpetrator is often unknown.The intent may not be clear. Given the ambiguity surrounding this matter, an urgent and appropriate response to cybercrime or cyberattack is recommended.

In addition to cybercrime, cyberattacks can also be linked to cyberwarfare or cyberterrorism, particularly in cases where the attackers are state actors or affiliated groups or organizations.

The National Cyber ​​Security Centre works closely with the Cybercrime Directorate of the General Directorate of Anti-Corruption and Economic and Electronic Security of the Ministry of Interior in the Kingdom of Bahrain, as these threats and risks affect national security, in addition to cases of increased threat directed at individuals or sectors.",technical,cybersecurity,

" What do you know about cybersecurity?
The concept of cybersecurity has become very widespread in recent years, as it has become circulated everywhere, and in almost every field. This spread comes from the widespread and extensive use of various digital platforms, which are accessed and browsed every day via the Internet, in addition to the clear reliance on the use of technology in various aspects of life, which was accompanied by a significant increase in the number of cyber attacks to which users of the global network are exposed. The following content shows the most important things related to various cybersecurity topics.

Definition of cybersecurity
Cybersecurity can be defined as the method or manner in which the risk of individuals and institutions being exposed to cyber attacks that occur via the Internet is reduced, ensuring the safety of computers, systems, electronic communications and networks, and the information and data they contain from hacking, espionage and sabotage. The cyberattacks that cybersecurity aims to reduce are referred to as cyberattacks. It is necessary to distinguish between cybersecurity and cyberspace; While cybersecurity refers to the process of protecting systems, data, communications and networks connected to the Internet, cyberspace expresses the digital environment in which all computer networks around the world are located, through which electronic communication occurs in all its forms. Cyberspace includes everything that exists in these networks from infrastructure such as computer systems, microcontrollers, processors, Internet networks, communications networks and many other information system infrastructures.

History of Cybersecurity
Before the advent of technology, the process of protecting the data of individuals and institutions was referred to through the concept of information security, which is concerned with protecting and preventing physical access by individuals to paper records and keeping them safe. After various data and information became available through digital and technical systems, the concept of cybersecurity emerged. The need to develop cybersecurity practices did not appear until the 1870s, when the first digital virus appeared in history, which was just a text message that was displayed on computers connected to the ""ARPANET"" network, which is one of the oldest forms of the current Internet. While this virus did not cause any technical damage to the infected devices at the time, it prompted the adoption of preventive technical measures to prevent such programs from accessing networks and devices. The beginnings of the emergence of the concept of cybersecurity in its current form date back to 1983 AD, when the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) was able to develop a system and a communication method based on the principle of encryption; thus, experts took this system as a pillar and a basic principle for developing modern means in the field of cybersecurity and protecting the digital world from various forms of threats.

The importance of cybersecurity
The concept of cybersecurity and its achievement is a shared responsibility of all individuals and institutions in society, and failure to implement the principles of this concept affects everyone; Infecting a specific device or technical system can expose other systems and devices to threats and danger. At the individual level, cybersecurity means protecting smartphones, computers, tablets, email, electronic banking services and what those services and electronic devices include, as well as other data and information specific to the user, and preventing them from being exposed to fraud, theft or spying over the Internet. At the level of institutions and companies, cybersecurity is very important in preserving and protecting businesses from what may expose them to damage to their data, systems and devices or expose them to destruction, which, if it happens, will result in many financial and operational effects for those institutions and companies, in addition to the loss of trust that these attacks may cause between institutions and their customers. The importance of cybersecurity is not limited to individuals and institutions, as this term is a fundamental pillar in protecting governments and countries; It is done by taking cybersecurity measures at the government level to protect the national data of the state and citizens and ensure the provision of electronic services correctly and securely, in addition to being important to prevent cyberattacks that may be taken by hostile countries or organizations. Types of Cybersecurity
Cybersecurity involves protecting five types of equipment and systems, which are as follows:

Infrastructure security: This type of cybersecurity deals with protection measures for vital infrastructure across multiple sectors such as communications, transportation, energy, health, and others.

Network security: This type of cybersecurity includes protecting networks and operating systems in them such as wireless access points, firewalls, and other components.

Cloud security: This type of cybersecurity deals with protecting data and information, and everything that exists through various cloud storage services and systems.

Internet of Things security: This type of cybersecurity deals with protecting and securing smart devices connected to the Internet.

Applications security: This type of cybersecurity deals with discovering and addressing vulnerabilities in applications, software, and websites.",technical,cybersecurity,
" Cybersecurity Concept Cybersecurity is defined as the use of technologies, processes, and measures necessary to ensure the security of systems, networks, programs, devices, and data and protect them from electronic attacks. Its main purpose is to reduce electronic risks that systems and networks may be exposed to and protect them from unauthorized exploitation. [1] The emergence of cybersecurity The following is an explanation of the stages of the emergence of cybersecurity: 1970s The emergence of cybersecurity dates back to the 1970s, a time when some terms such as spyware, viruses, and electronic worms were not common. [2] Due to the high rate of cybercrime, these terms appeared in daily news headlines. When going back in time to the emergence of cybersecurity, computers and the Internet were still under development, and it was easy to identify threats to which the computer might be exposed. [2] 1980s In the 1980s, Robert T. Morris created the first electronic virus program, which received massive media coverage due to its spread among Devices and causing system malfunctions, Morris was sentenced to prison and a fine, and this ruling played a role in developing laws related to cybersecurity. [2] The 1990s The development of cybersecurity events continued over time, with the development of viruses that infect devices, as the world became aware of electronic risks, and one of the most prominent measures taken in the 1990s was the development of website protection protocols such as (http), which is one of the types of protocols that allow the user to securely access the Internet. [2] Types of cybersecurity There are different types of cybersecurity, including the following: [3] Network Security, in which computers are protected from attacks that may be exposed to inside and outside the network, and one of the most prominent technologies used to implement network security is the firewall that acts as a protector between the personal device and other devices on the network, in addition to email security. Application Security, in which information related to an application on a computer is protected, such as password procedures, authentication processes, and security questions that ensure the identity of the application user. Cloud Security Cloud programs are known as data storage and preservation programs over the Internet, and many resort to saving their data through electronic programs instead of local storage programs, which led to the emergence of the need to protect that data, so cloud programs are concerned with providing the necessary protection for their users. Operational Security is the management of internal cybersecurity operations risks, in which risk management experts are employed to find an alternative plan in the event that user data is exposed to a cyber attack, and it also includes raising awareness and training employees on best practices to avoid risks. Cybersecurity goals The following are the most prominent goals that cybersecurity seeks to achieve: Data availability Data availability refers to the property that allows authorized persons to access and modify data and information at an appropriate time, i.e. ensuring reliable and continuous access to information, and among the most prominent methods used to provide secure data are: physical protection and computer backup support. [4] Integrity The term integrity refers to the means used to ensure the accuracy and integrity of data, and protect it from modification by any unauthorized user; It is the property that aims to prevent information from being changed in an unauthorized manner, and to ensure that the source of the information is real. [4] Among the most important techniques that cybersecurity employs to ensure integrity are: backups, test sets, and data modification codes. [4] Confidentiality Confidentiality is equivalent to the concept of privacy, in which unauthorized disclosure of information is avoided, data protection is ensured, access is provided to trusted persons, and others are not allowed to know the content of that data. Examples of this include data encryption, which allows access only to those who can decrypt that data. [4] Among the most important techniques that cybersecurity employs to ensure confidentiality are: encryption, controlling access to data, authentication, authorization, and physical security. [4] Cybersecurity problems There are many difficulties and threats surrounding cybersecurity that put the information security sector on alert, including the following: [5] Increasing the complexity of cyberattacks Among the problems of cybersecurity is the increasing complexity of cyberattacks in conjunction with the advancement of the electronic field, as the development of machine learning, artificial intelligence, cryptocurrencies, and others has resulted in To the increase in malware that exposes the data of companies, governments and individuals to constant risk. Anonymity The emergence of some technologies such as cryptocurrencies Bitcoin, has a role in anonymizing users, which has allowed fraudsters to deploy techniques to steal information without fear of revealing their identity. Lack of experts in the cybersecurity sector The severe shortage of experts that the cybersecurity sector suffers from, as this field suffers from a lack of specialists in it. Insecure Internet Connection Over-reliance on insecure Internet connection can lead to the collapse of information exchange systems and increase the likelihood of the spread of malware. Spread of misinformation The deliberate dissemination of misinformation using robots or automated sources, which puts the safety of users of electronic information at risk. The development of fraud operations The increase in fraud operations by deception, as some have begun to target people's data by deceiving them into clicking on a link and the lack of awareness among people about this, and the use of e-learning in formulating more convincing messages to deceive educated people about the operations ofFor fraud. Physical cyber attacks Physical cyber attacks go beyond electronic data; there are now those who attack data on water stations, electricity stations, and trains. Accessibility to additional parties (third parties) Third parties mean that the user allows other parties to access his data, such as logging into sites using social media applications or email, which allows users of those sites to access the person’s information. The importance of cyber security Cyber ​​security is of great importance because it protects users’ data from cyber attacks aimed at stealing information and using it to cause harm. This may be sensitive data, government and industrial information, or personal information. [6] The presence of advanced electronic defense programs and means to protect data is important, as society needs to protect vital infrastructure that includes hospitals, other health care institutions, financial services programs, and power stations. [6] On the individual level, cyber attacks can lead to identity theft and extortion attempts, which can cause serious harm to the individual if the security of his data is not paid attention to.

" The difference between cybersecurity and information security
The difference between cybersecurity and information security is great, and although both revolve around information security, each one of them has a certain difference.

Because we know that many students and people are looking for the difference between cybersecurity and information security, we decided to prepare this brief and comprehensive article.

First, we will talk about the definition of both specializations and the essential points of difference between them and examples of the applications of each one of them, so you have learned the difference between cybersecurity and information security quickly and in boring detail.

The difference between cybersecurity and information security in brief
The main difference between cybersecurity and information security is in the type of data and information that each of them protects, meaning that cybersecurity studies how to provide security for electronic information only, while information security studies how to achieve information security in its various forms such as paper or electronic and other types.

Based on the above, information security is the most comprehensive specialization as it studies the protection of all types of data, including cybersecurity, and this is, in short, the difference between cybersecurity and information security.

The concept of information security
It is abbreviated as infosec, which is the science that aims primarily to provide information security systems of various types and protect them from any threat such as theft and unauthorized access. We will give you an example that explains the difference more.

Imagine that a company has a huge amount of paper information and wants to convert it into digital information and data. There is no doubt that it needs both specializations, information security and cybersecurity. First, the role of the information security specialist is:

1 - Safe storage
That is, to achieve the security of the most important files, whether paper or digital, within servers or hard disks.

2 - Protection
That is, to protect important documents from any access except for the authorized employee.

3 - Identity verification
That means applying modern technologies to ensure the reliability of people, such as including personal identity in access.

4 - Confronting threats
That is, verifying the security of documents by confronting any internal or external attacks by employees.

5 - Security reports
That is, monitoring and verifying the extent of data security and the absence of any suspicious activity that harms the information.

These were simple examples of the applications and tasks of an information security expert in real life, now let's get to know the role of cybersecurity to clarify the difference between cybersecurity and information security more.

The concept of cybersecurity
The word cyber can be replaced by the word electronic, i.e. electronic security, which means a set of measures taken to protect devices, networks and data in cyberspace.

That is, it is not limited to protecting data only, but protecting everything that has a connection to the Internet and electronics such as computers, car systems and drones. This is the second point of difference between it and information security, and in continuation of the previous example, the role of cybersecurity at this stage is to protect information:

1 - Provide strong passwords
That is, prepare strong passwords for all company networks and sites, used to protect sites and programs to ensure that they are difficult for others to hack.

2 - Update programs
Updating the company's programs and applications contributes to closing gaps and improving the operation of systems as well as ensuring better protection for them.

3 - Identify suspicious applications
That is, ensure that no suspicious or unsafe applications are downloaded in running business via the computer.

4 - Verify links

Protecting users from opening or using any suspicious and unsafe links.

These were simple examples of the role of the cybersecurity specialist and also information security, which simply illustrate the difference between cybersecurity and information security.

The impact of cybersecurity and information security on companies
1 - Protecting electronic data and information
Cybersecurity and information security are two essential elements in protecting customers' electronic data and important information for the company, and if that data is hacked, it may cause a loss of customer confidence, thus causing significant financial losses

2 - Ensuring trust and improving brand reputation
The presence of a team that includes cybersecurity and information security specialists ensures that cyber attacks are addressed and that customer data is not spread.

3 - Reducing financial costs
Recovering from cyber attacks, compensating affected customers, and restoring lost data is very expensive, so the role of the information security and cybersecurity specialist comes in avoiding cyber threats.

4 - Cybersecurity and Information Security Help Growth
It is easier for companies to implement new technologies in cloud computing or artificial intelligence, if there is a cybersecurity and information security team capable of confronting any hacking or cyber attacks.

5 - The Future of Cybersecurity and Information Security
Both cybersecurity and information security are promising specialties in the future, especially with the development of information technologies and the increase in hacking operations and cyber threats, so the demand must increase by 35% for specialists who have the ability to protect information from any unauthorized access, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics.

The difference between cybersecurity and information security in terms of demand?

The demand for both specialties varies according to the market and industry, but in our current era, the demand for cybersecurity may be higher than information security, due to rapid technological developments and the emergence of many forms of cyber threats.

Despite the above, neither of them can be dispensed with in preparing an integrated team whose job is to fully protect information.

" The difference between information security and cybersecurity:
The difference between information security and cybersecurity is that cybersecurity is a subset of information security; however, not all fields are exactly the same; each has distinct specializations and requires different skill sets. Both information security and cybersecurity depend on protecting the information that we want to store, protect and transmit in cyberspace. However, although cybersecurity is part of information security, some aspects of information security are not included in the field of cybersecurity. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has recognized both information security and cybersecurity as separate functional areas, and that there is certainly overlap between them. The following are the definitions of each and the differences between them.

1. The concept of information security:

Most people want their personal information to be secure so that no one can access and use it except authorized people, and this is the goal of information security (Infosec).

According to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), ICT involves protecting information and its systems from unauthorized use. The field aims to provide availability, integrity, and confidentiality. One way to understand ICT compared to cybersecurity is to look at the field as an umbrella term that includes all data, not just data stored in cyberspace. This highlights how cybersecurity is a type of information security; however, they are not the same. While information security teams create and implement policies and systems to protect information, for large organizations, strict security systems are required to protect customers.

Information security can be simply described as preventing unauthorized access or alteration while data is stored or transferred from one device to another. This information could be biometrics, social media profiles, mobile data, and more. It covers information security research in various sectors including cryptocurrencies and online forensics.

Information security is created to cover three goals: confidentiality, integrity, and availability, or what is known as “CIA.” Data must be kept confidential, including personal information, high-value information, and it is important to prevent any unauthorized access.

Moving on to integration, stored data must be kept in the correct order; hence, any unorganized modification by an unauthorized person must be immediately revoked, but authorized personnel must be able to access stored data at any time. To ensure effective operation of information security, organizations have developed several policies such as access control policy, password policy, data support and operational plans. Procedures can also include logos, network intrusion detection systems, and regulatory compliance.

2. Cybersecurity Concept:

Cybersecurity can be defined as the defense of computers, servers, mobile devices, electronic systems, networks, and data from malicious attacks ranging from business organizations to personal devices. Attacks are divided into several categories, including: network security, application security, information security, operational security, disaster recovery, and business continuity.

Both network security and application security focus on securing computer networks along with software and hardware free from threats and vulnerabilities respectively, while disaster recovery is related to the organization's response in the event of data loss and attempts to restore its operational capabilities in order to continue the organization's work. There are several types of attacks known to a certain extent and can be divided into categories: cybercrimes targeting financial gain, cyberattacks which are mostly political, and cyberterrorism.

These attacks are organized using different media, including: malware including viruses and Trojans, spyware, ransomware, adware, botnets, SQL injection phishing, etc. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has defined cybersecurity as the protection, prevention of damage, and recovery of electronic communications services and systems, including the information stored in these systems. Cybersecurity also covers everything related to electronic systems and communications, cloud services, networks, and critical infrastructure security.

Overlaps between Information Security and Cybersecurity:

Information Security and Cybersecurity overlap in several ways, and in addition to having similar security practices, they also require similar education and skills.

1. Common Security Practices:

The most significant overlap between Information Security and Cybersecurity is that they both use the CIA’s three-pronged model to develop security policies: confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information.

2. Confidentiality of Information:

Ensures that only authorized users can access and modify information. From a consumer perspective, we expect online retailers to store and protect our data, such as credit card information, home addresses, and other personal information.

3. Integrity of Information:

Integrity of information ensures that it has not been tampered with and is completely reliable. If we go back to the example of an online retailer, the data transmitted between the retailer and his bank must be secure. If it is not, there will be a discrepancy between the actual cost of your goods and the amount you paid.

4. Availability of Information:

Availability of information means that the data is available when you need it; For example, if you want to know how much money is in your bank account, you need to be able to access that information.

The difference between Information Security and Cyber ​​Security:

Both the terms cyber security and information security are related to the security of computer systems, and are often used as synonyms, but should not be interchangeable. The difference between information security and cyber security can be summarized in the following points:

Cyber ​​Security

Information Security

Cyber ​​security aims to protect attacks in cyberspace such as data, storage sources, devices, etc.

Information security aims to create and maintain systems and policies and protect data from all forms of threats, regardless of their type: analog, digital, and physical, not just data.

Cyber ​​security deals with cybercrime, cyber fraud, and law enforcement.

While information security deals with unauthorized access, modification, detection, and disruption.

Cyber ​​security professionals deal with advanced persistent threats (APT), and are specially trained to do so.

Information security lays the foundation for data security and trains them to prioritize resources before dealing with threats or attacks.

An information security expert develops means of accessing data for authorized individuals and puts in place security measures to maintain the integrity of information.

While cybersecurity focuses on protecting information from cyber attacks such as ransomware and spyware.

In conclusion:

It is worth noting that whatever the difference between information security and cybersecurity, we need both of them in an era of increasing online threats in organizations every second to ensure a safe environment; hence the need for security professionals has increased. ",technical,cybersecurity,
" As we move towards 2025, the cyber landscape will continue to evolve at an unprecedented pace. As cyberattacks become more sophisticated and technology evolves rapidly, we will need to adopt a more effective digital defense strategy.

This article explores the top five cybersecurity developments that will help you protect your data in the coming year.

1. AI-Based Cybersecurity Solutions

We are all witnessing how AI is changing many areas, including cybersecurity. Machine learning algorithms are now able to spot trends, recognize patterns, and differences that indicate potential cyber threats, allowing organizations to respond quickly and mitigate the impact of a breach.

Accordingly, AI-based systems are expected to become more sophisticated, enhancing their ability to detect cyber threats. Furthermore, AI is increasingly being used to automate routine security checks, freeing up the human element to perform more complex tasks.

2- Expanding the use of the “Zero Trust Security Model”

The Zero Trust Security Model works according to the principle of “never trust, investigate first”. The Zero Trust Security Model was first introduced in 2010 by cybersecurity expert John Kindervaag. Since then, it has evolved as a result of the constant need to improve security measures in the ever-changing digital landscape.

The model is characterized by the application of strict security measures to verify the identity of users and devices, ensuring maximum protection. By assuming that threats emerge from both inside and outside the network, the Zero Trust Security Model reduces the risks of unauthorized access and data breaches, laying the foundations for a strong security system for 2025 and beyond.

3- Focus on Supply Chain Security

Security gaps in relationships with external partners have become evident during recent cyber attacks, especially those targeting supply chains. As a result, industries have become increasingly important in ensuring the security of their networks and warehouses.

Enhancing supply chain security is an effective strategy to mitigate the risk of cyber attacks that exploit external partners’ vulnerabilities, and is usually implemented in three steps. The first step is to assess the risks that may arise from the partners, followed by imposing strict security standards on them, and finally, monitoring their activities continuously.

4- The emergence of privacy-enhancing technologies

With the increasing concerns of users and regulators about data privacy, the technology industry will witness an increase in the use of user privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) in 2025. Privacy-enhancing technologies rely on technologies that allow data to be analyzed seamlessly without the risk of revealing sensitive information, such as differential privacy and homomorphic encryption.

Thus, by using privacy-enhancing technologies, organizations can protect users’ personal data and comply with data protection regulations to increase customer confidence in them.

5- Focus on developing cybersecurity skills

With the continuous increase in demand for cybersecurity experts and their small numbers, the gap between supply and demand is widening. In 2025, organizations are expected to increase their investments in training and professional development programs, with the aim of enhancing the skills of their employees and attracting more talent.

By bridging this skills gap, organizations will be able to enhance their technical capabilities and expertise in addressing complex security challenges. Companies should also find ways to partner with educational institutions to help students gain the skills needed to address new cyber threats.",technical,cybersecurity,
" What is cybersecurity?

It is the protection of networks, information technology systems, operational technology systems and their components, including hardware and software, and the services they provide and the data they contain from any hacking, disruption, modification, entry, use or illegal exploitation.

What is the importance of cybersecurity?

Cybersecurity protects your sensitive information such as your bank cards, electronic accounts and confidential packages from viruses and electronic attacks and protects you from extortion attempts.

What are the types of cybersecurity?

1- Cloud security:

A means of protecting information and personal data as it is stored in what is known as the electronic cloud.

2- Application security:

Protecting various sensitive information at the level of the application itself that the user uses, such as the process of asking the user to put a strong password or setting security questions.

3- Network security:

Protects the computer network from any hacking or attack, whether from inside or outside the network.

What are the threats to cybersecurity?

- Ransomware

Designed to blackmail the victim by blocking access to their files and withholding them until a certain amount is paid.

- Social engineering

A method used by adversaries to lure you into revealing sensitive information such as your accounts and passwords.

- Phishing Pages

Designing a page similar to the page of the site from which accounts are to be hacked or user information stolen.

- Remote access trojan

Designed to secretly control the victim's device, such as browsing, downloading, and deleting files, operating the device's camera and microphone, etc.

- Spreading viruses (Worms)

Designed to spread in the victim's device files or in flash memory.

- Adware viruses (Adware)

A type of software that displays unwanted advertisements on a computer or mobile device. These advertisements may appear in the form of pop-up windows, or they can be integrated into software or web pages. These programs are usually installed without the user's knowledge or through free software that comes with them. Their main purpose is to generate income for the developers by displaying advertisements.",technical,cybersecurity,
" For Facts News: His Majesty the King's Deputy, His Royal Highness Crown Prince Al Hussein bin Abdullah II, yesterday sponsored the launch of the second Jordan Cybersecurity Summit 2024, organized by the National Cybersecurity Center.

The summit, which annually brings together businessmen and experts specializing in cybersecurity, aims to enhance the protection of official and private institutions in Jordan, and provide a safe, attractive and business-friendly environment, in addition to enhancing international cooperation in the field of cybersecurity.

The two-day summit is attended by more than 50 speakers from several countries, and includes more than 25 discussion sessions and workshops that discuss the challenges facing institutions in the field of cybersecurity.

The summit seeks to coordinate efforts to combat cross-border cybercrimes, as well as explore areas of innovation in cybersecurity technologies, including the use of artificial intelligence in detecting and responding to threats.

During the summit yesterday, experts in the field of technology and cybersecurity stressed the importance of building a cohesive system that supports cybersecurity on the one hand and developing proactive and remedial plans for global cyber attacks that may occur at any moment on the other hand.

The experts explained that this system depends on raising people's awareness on the one hand and urging institutions and decision-makers to use modern technologies, especially artificial intelligence, on the other hand, which leads to strengthening a strong cybersecurity system in any institution or country.

The experts at the summit discussed many issues and topics, including emerging cyber threats and how to respond to them, international cooperation in the field of cybersecurity and ways to enhance it, mechanisms for exchanging information about threats and coordinating efforts to combat cross-border cybercrimes, in addition to discussing issues of innovation in cybersecurity technologies, including the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning in detecting and responding to threats.

In his opening speech, Eng. Bassam Al-Maharmeh, Head of the National Cybersecurity Center, stressed the importance of holding the second Jordan Cybersecurity Summit in the field of awareness, and opening the doors of dialogue between officials, experts and youth to learn about the latest developments in cybersecurity.

He pointed out the importance of harnessing modern technologies to enhance the cybersecurity system in Jordan, and caring for the field of awareness for all are factors included in the national cybersecurity strategy that was recently formulated by the center in cooperation with all relevant parties.

They said, ""The Jordan Cybersecurity Summit comes in line with the royal vision aimed at making Jordan a regional center in the field of technology, and aims to transform the Kingdom To an innovative knowledge society that possesses the capabilities and potential required to meet the challenges of the global knowledge economy.

He pointed out that holding the summit is a practical translation of the directives of His Highness the Crown Prince, which emphasize the necessity of developing the national cybersecurity system, with the aim of enhancing the protection of official and private institutions in the Kingdom and providing a safe and attractive environment for investment and supportive of business.

He explained that the summit aims to confront the increasing challenges in the digital space, and enhance international cooperation to ensure a safe and stable cyberspace for all, noting that the summit acquires exceptional importance in light of the increasing challenges facing the world in cyberspace.

Al-Maharmah said, ""The importance of the summit is evident in several points, the most important of which are: unifying global efforts in confronting the increasing cyber threats, exchanging experiences and knowledge between experts and specialists, regional and international cooperation by providing a platform for dialogue and exchange of ideas in the field of cybersecurity, anticipating the future of cybersecurity and the potential challenges facing the world in the coming years, and developing policies and legislation related to cybersecurity at the national and international levels by discussing best practices and successful experiences.""

Former Minister of Communications Marwan Gomaa said in a dialogue session he participated in yesterday at the summit, ""The digital transformation around the world and in all sectors and the increasing spread of Internet services and their use by all segments of society, is a great opportunity for hackers and a space for cyber attacks that will not stop, and accordingly we must work hard today to enhance cyber security and by everyone: governments, institutions, and individuals.""

Gomaa stressed the importance of awareness and the adoption of cyber security technologies and strategies by decision-makers to become a basic component in the structures of companies, institutions, and governments so that we do not fall victim to ongoing cyber attacks.

He stressed that the focus of awareness is a basic factor today to educate people, decision-makers, institutions, and youth, which saves us a lot of losses in the event that we fall victim to piracy.

He pointed out that governments must be fully aware that cyber security must be a basic component of the digital transformation strategy that they implement, and decision-makers must introduce it and adopt it seriously in the work strategies of companies and institutions so that the digital transformation process becomes beneficial away from the losses of piracy.

He stressed the importance of basic and university education and the inclusion and promotion of the topic of cybersecurity in curricula and in students' use of technology in their lives or in their entrepreneurial projects.

He pointed out the importance of the Second Jordan Cybersecurity Summit as a successful example that should be repeated in the future and maintained as it opens up large dialogue spaces for everyone, specialists and non-specialists, to learn about the latest developments in cybersecurity and benefit from each other's experiences.

For his part, the CEO of the ""Intaj"" Association, Eng. Nidal Al-Baytar, stressed that the issue of investment and focus by governments and institutions on the axis of cybersecurity in their policies and components has become a necessity today and not a luxury.

He stressed the importance of awareness at the level of individuals and government and private institutions and the use of modern technologies in strengthening the cybersecurity system of any country and in Jordan.

Al-Baytar said, ""The progress achieved by the Jordan's recent ranking in the Global Cybersecurity Index is a new achievement for the Jordanian technology sector, which should be built upon and benefited from, reflecting a good reputation for Jordan and its technology sector, as Jordan ranked 27th globally out of 194 countries, compared to its ranking of 71st globally in the previous report.

He stressed that Jordan's progress in the Global Cybersecurity Index is a reflection of the integrated efforts between various sectors, and the Kingdom's commitment to the right path to develop its cyber infrastructure.

Al-Bitar added, ""This progress is an important step towards strengthening Jordan's position as a regional center for cybersecurity, and confirms the effectiveness of the policies adopted by the Kingdom in this field, which enhances the confidence of international and local investors.""

According to the ""Intaj"" Association, the local market has witnessed a growth in the number of companies specialized in providing cybersecurity solutions, with more than 50 companies operating in this field, some of which cooperate with international companies to provide advanced services, in addition to the fact that there are many international companies that have cyber monitoring operations centers in Jordan.

Production figures show that there are about 500 graduates from Jordanian universities annually in cybersecurity specializations.

In a related context, Haider Pasha, Chief Security Officer at Palo Alto Networks, a cybersecurity company, stressed that today we must focus a lot on modern technologies and their use and adaptation to serve cybersecurity.

Pasha said, ""At the forefront of these technologies that must be focused on, followed up on, and adapted to serve cybersecurity today is artificial intelligence, which is developing rapidly today, so that we are approaching the barrier of one billion users of artificial intelligence technologies in the world."" He stressed that just as artificial intelligence works to accelerate and facilitate hacker attacks, we must adapt it optimally in two aspects: in monitoring and early detection of cyberattacks, and in dealing with them and dealing with them as a response after they occur.

He stressed that artificial intelligence, with all its modern technologies, has become a time saver and saves us a lot of effort and time that we used to spend previously on development and protection procedures, both proactively and later, in the field of cybersecurity.

He said, “Awareness is an important factor to avoid falling victim to hacking. Today, many people and employees in all institutions use artificial intelligence applications and provide a lot of data without setting limits or precautions for hacking, which exposes them to danger. This large amount of data and artificial intelligence applications have become a great opportunity for hackers around the world.”",technical,cybersecurity,

" Challenges are increasing in the digital age, most notably cyber attacks targeting information and data security. Cybersecurity is a vital part of the world of modern technology to protect electronic systems and networks from cyber threats. The Kingdom has framed its efforts in this field by establishing the National Cybersecurity Authority to keep pace with technical developments, maintain community security, and ensure the safety of the work of various state sectors, considering this a vital requirement. Rather, it has given information security and electronic services a high priority with the development of electronic government services and the transformations witnessed by the Kingdom in light of Vision 2030.

The Kingdom has been interested in qualifying specialized cadres in the field of cybersecurity and related fields, whether through scholarship programs or what Saudi universities provide in the field of information security specializations; to provide students with the knowledge and skills necessary to protect information from the increasing risk of cybercrimes.

The Kingdom ranked second globally in the Cybersecurity Index, according to the World Competitiveness Yearbook 2023 report issued by the World Competitiveness Center of the International Institute for Management Development in Switzerland (IMD), which aims to analyze and rank countries' ability to create a supportive and stimulating environment for competitiveness, maintain and develop it, which reflects the development witnessed by the Kingdom in this field.

The cybersecurity sector in the Kingdom is witnessing continuous development through a number of initiatives represented by the launch of the National Portal for Cybersecurity Services ""Haseen""; to provide innovative cyber services and solutions, provide qualitative programs to build national human capacities and enhance their competitiveness locally and globally, empower entrepreneurs and innovators, issue regulations to enhance cybersecurity, follow up on the commitment of national entities to them, and launch international initiatives to support efforts and unify joint endeavors.

This position has qualified the Kingdom to lead Arab cybersecurity, as the leaders of the Arab countries adopted the basic system of the Arab Cybersecurity Ministers Council, at the (33) summit meeting of the Council of the League of Arab States, held in the Kingdom of Bahrain last Thursday, where the League Council welcomed the proposal of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to establish an Arab Ministerial Council for Cybersecurity with its permanent headquarters in Riyadh.",technical,cybersecurity,

" Definition of cyber security:

Cyber ​​security is the application of techniques, processes, and controls to protect systems, networks, programs, devices, and data from cyber attacks. To learn cyber security and learn its learning path, click here

It aims to reduce the risk of cyber attacks and protect against unauthorized exploitation of systems, networks, and technologies

Who needs cyber security?

It is a mistake to think that you are not interested in cyber attackers. Everyone connected to the Internet needs cyber security. This is because most cyber attacks are automated and aim to exploit common vulnerabilities rather than specific websites or organizations.1

Types of cyber threats:

Common cyber threats include:

Malware, such as ransomware, botnets, RATs (remote access Trojans), rootkits and boot kits, spyware, Trojans, viruses, and worms.

Backdoors, which allow remote access.

Formjacking, which inserts malicious code into online forms.
Cryptojacking, which installs illegal cryptocurrency mining software.

DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks, which flood servers, systems and networks with traffic to shut them down.

DNS (Domain Name System) poisoning attacks, which compromise DNS to redirect traffic to malicious sites.

What are the five types of cybersecurity?

Cybersecurity Cybersecurity
Critical infrastructure cybersecurity:
Critical infrastructure organisations are often more vulnerable to attack than others because their SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) systems often rely on outdated software.

Essential service operators in the UK’s energy, transport, health, water and digital infrastructure sectors and digital service providers are bound by the NIS Regulations.

The regulations require organisations to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to manage their security risks.

Network security
Network security involves addressing vulnerabilities that affect operating systems and network architecture, including servers, hosts, firewalls, wireless access points and network protocols.

Cloud Security
Cloud security is concerned with securing data, applications and infrastructure in the cloud.

IoT Security
IoT security involves securing smart devices and networks connected to the Internet of Things. IoT devices that connect to the Internet without human intervention include smart fire alarms, lights, thermostats and other devices.

Application Assurance
Application security involves addressing vulnerabilities created by insecure development processes in the design, coding and deployment of software or a website.

What are the consequences of a cyber attack?

Cyber ​​attacks can cost organisations billions of pounds and cause significant damage. Affected organisations will lose sensitive data and face fines and reputational damage.

Cyber ​​Security Management

Effective cyber security management must come from the top of the organisation.

A strong cyber security culture, reinforced by regular training, will ensure that every employee recognises cyber security as their responsibility.

Good security and effective business practices must go hand in hand.

How to Deal with Cybersecurity:

A risk-based approach to cybersecurity will ensure that your efforts are focused where they are needed most.

Using regular cybersecurity risk assessments to identify and assess your risks is the most effective and cost-effective way to protect your organization.

Cybersecurity vs. Information Security:

Cybersecurity is often confused with information security.

Cybersecurity focuses on protecting computer systems from unauthorized access, damage, or inaccessibility.

Information security is a broader category that protects all information assets, whether in print or digital form.

Cybersecurity Checklist:

Strengthen your cyber defenses with these essential security measures:

1. Educate Users

Human error is the leading cause of data breaches. Therefore, you should equip employees with the knowledge to deal with the threats they face.

Employee awareness training will show employees how security threats affect them and help them apply best practice tips to real-world situations.

2. Application Assurance

Web application vulnerabilities are a common point of intervention for cybercriminals.

As applications play an increasingly important role in business, it is imperative to focus on web application security.

3. Network Security

Network security is the process of protecting the usability and integrity of your network and data. This is accomplished by performing network penetration testing, which assesses your network for vulnerabilities and security issues.

4. Leadership Commitment

Leadership commitment is key to cyber resilience. Without it, it is difficult to establish or enforce effective processes. Senior management must be willing to invest in appropriate cybersecurity resources, such as awareness training.

" Modern societies increasingly rely on information and communication technologies connected to the global network. However, this increasing dependence is accompanied by a set of emerging and potential risks that primarily threaten the network, information security, the information society and its members. The growing misuse of electronic networks for criminal purposes negatively affects the integrity of sensitive national information infrastructures, especially personal information and the safety of children.

Cybersecurity has become an essential part of any national security policy, as it is known that decision-makers in the United States of America, the European Union, Russia, China, India and other countries have begun to classify cyber defense/cybersecurity issues as a priority in their national defense policies. In addition to the above, more than 130 countries around the world have announced the allocation of special sections and scenarios for cyber warfare within national security teams. All these efforts are in addition to traditional security efforts to combat cybercrime, electronic fraud and other aspects of cyber risks.

In other words, cybersecurity is the sum of legal and regulatory frameworks, organizational structures, workflow procedures, as well as technical and technological means that represent the joint efforts of the private and public sectors, local and international, aimed at protecting the national cyberspace, with a focus on ensuring the availability of information systems, strengthening privacy and protecting the confidentiality of personal information, and taking all necessary measures to protect citizens and consumers from the risks of cyberspace.

ITU recommendations and international best practices show that cybersecurity depends on a complex mix of technical, political, social and cultural challenges.

More specifically, the validity of national cybersecurity depends on the following five pillars:

Developing a national strategy for cybersecurity and protecting sensitive information infrastructure
Establishing national cooperation between the government and the ICT industry community
Deterring cybercrime
Creating national capabilities to manage computer incidents
Stimulating a national culture of cybersecurity
The starting point for national cybersecurity begins with developing a national policy to raise awareness about cybersecurity issues and the need for national measures and international cooperation. The second step is to develop a national plan to stimulate cybersecurity with the aim of reducing the risks and effects of cyber threats, and includes participation in international and regional efforts to stimulate national prevention of, preparation for, response to, and recovery from cyber incidents.",technical,cybersecurity,
" The Information and Decision Support Center of the Cabinet highlighted the report issued by the World Economic Forum entitled ""Global Cybersecurity Outlook 2025"", which addresses the increasing complexity of the cyber landscape and its profound impact on institutions and countries, indicating that this complexity is not limited to technical aspects only, but also includes economic and social dimensions that require a comprehensive and integrated response.

The report explained that the factors contributing to the complexity of the cyber landscape are geopolitical tensions, complex supply chains, emerging technologies, regulatory requirements, and a lack of skills, as international conflicts and tensions increase uncertainty and make cyber attacks a tool in these conflicts, as governments, vital infrastructure, and economies are targeted, while reliance on intertwined supply chains leads to the emergence of vulnerabilities that can be exploited, and the lack of transparency and oversight of supplier security increases these risks.

In addition, the rapid adoption of technologies such as artificial intelligence contributes to the emergence of new security vulnerabilities, which cybercriminals exploit to enhance their attack methods. As for regulatory requirements, the proliferation of different laws and regulations around the world may increase the burden on organizations that find it difficult to comply with them. The report added that the shortage of specialized skills in cybersecurity contributes to exacerbating the situation, as many organizations lack the necessary competencies to manage cyber risks.

The report indicated that the effects of this complexity are represented in several points, including:

- Exacerbating cyber disparities: The increasing complexity leads to an increase in the gap between large and small organizations, developed and developing countries, and small organizations struggle to secure themselves, while large organizations advance steadily.

- Evolution of cyber attacks: The number of cyber attacks is increasing and their methods are evolving, especially with the use of artificial intelligence by cybercriminals, making ransomware, fraud and phishing attacks more prevalent.

- Risks to critical infrastructure: Critical infrastructure has become an increasing target for cyber attacks, jeopardizing public safety and national security.

- Risks in biotechnology: Developments in these fields lead to the emergence of new risks that require advanced security measures, as attacks can disrupt research or compromise sensitive data.

The Information and Decision Support Center confirmed that the report stated that in response to these challenges, artificial intelligence can be exploited in defense, as the security of artificial intelligence tools must be assessed before they are deployed, and artificial intelligence can enhance defense capabilities by quickly detecting and responding to risks. Institutions must also adopt a comprehensive approach to risk management, focusing on identifying and assessing risks and implementing preventive measures, as well as enhancing cooperation, as cooperation between the public and private sectors and between different countries should be enhanced to confront cross-border cyber threats, with a focus on exchanging information and threats.

The Information Center reviewed a number of recommendations resulting from the forum to enhance the quality of cybersecurity and avoid the resulting risks, through:

- Investing in cybersecurity: Cybersecurity should be considered a strategic investment and not just an expense, with the necessary resources allocated to enhance defense capabilities.

- Skills development: Focus should be placed on developing skills in the field of cybersecurity, especially skills related to artificial intelligence.

- Raising awareness: Awareness of the importance of cybersecurity should be raised throughout society, with all employees understanding cyber risks and participating in promoting a culture of security.

- Preparing for the future: Prepare for future threats by initiating risk assessments and implementing preventive measures.

The report concluded that the cyber landscape is complex and constantly changing, requiring a rapid and integrated response from all stakeholders. Therefore, institutions and countries must work together to enhance cyber resilience, protect critical infrastructure, and ensure data and information security.",technical,cybersecurity,
" Cybersecurity Best Practices

Let's now discover together in this article the areas that cybersecurity managers need to prioritize within the organization, we will mention 6 cybersecurity best practices that will enhance the protection of the organization and its data.

Cybersecurity Practices

1. Regular Patching
Cybersecurity managers must take into account the topic of patch management when developing the organization's cybersecurity strategy so that it is a major part of the cybersecurity strategy, and we have previously published an article that talks about the steps to build a cybersecurity strategy for your organization.

New vulnerabilities are discovered all the time and unless the appropriate patches are applied, attackers will exploit these vulnerabilities to access your network.

What are security vulnerabilities?
A security bug is a term used to describe weak areas in computer operating systems. These weak areas can be infiltrated into the operating system, and then modified to destroy it completely, for example, or to spy on the private information of the owner of the hacked computer, or what is known as the victim's device.

Vulnerabilities appear in all software, not just operating systems, and are due to programming errors made by developers. They pose a security risk because they are sometimes not discovered to issue a solution and patch for them, such as Zero-day vulnerabilities that hackers always use in their cybercrimes.

So what is a patch?
A patch is basically a piece of code that is installed in an existing software program to correct a problem or improve the overall stability of the application. It is necessary to keep devices up to date, stable, and secure from malware and other threats.

It can also be defined as a set of changes to a computer program or supporting data designed to update, fix, or improve it. This includes fixing security vulnerabilities and other errors. These patches are usually called bug fixes.

It is estimated that patching prevents up to 85% of all cyber attacks (cyber attacks), so it is essential for your organization to apply these patches as soon as they are available.

The negligence of the cybersecurity manager in monitoring the application of patches and not implementing them within the organization can have disastrous results for the organization's business.

2. Two-Factor Authentication
You must have heard of two-factor authentication before when trying to secure your accounts on some websites and applications such as Facebook. We will now explain what two-factor authentication is, how it works, and what benefits you will gain from implementing it within your organization.

Two-factor authentication provides an additional layer of security that can make a big difference between a hacking attempt and a data breach that hinders work.

Two-Factor Authentication

In addition to the username and password, two-factor authentication requires additional information to confirm the user’s identity. This information may be a personal identification number, a unique code, or even biometric data such as a fingerprint.

Two-Factor Authentication is one of the simplest ways to keep sensitive company information private and secure from interception or access by hackers. Two-factor authentication may be used in your organization either to log in, reset a password, or to provide a stronger authentication process to protect sensitive data such as personal or financial information.

With the increasing number of employees now working remotely, which has increased dramatically during the Corona pandemic, two-factor authentication enables them to access company data without compromising company networks, and this is a great benefit that two-factor authentication adds when you want to implement your work remotely.

3. High-quality security training for employees
The organization's employees are the first line of defense for the organization, and at the same time, a single employee who is irresponsible or unaware of the risks of cyber attacks can cause significant losses to the organization and even make it easy prey for attackers and hackers. As hacking networks becomes more difficult, hackers are increasingly targeting employees because they provide the easiest way to hack the network.

90% of all successful cyber attacks are the result of information provided by employees without their knowledge.

Now let's look at how to prevent this from happening within the organization
The solution is easy here and only requires more attention from the organization's cybersecurity managers, by taking some time to be closer to the employees in the organization and helping them through effective security awareness training, which is essential to train employees on how to identify a set of cybersecurity threats and respond to them appropriately.

If you don’t have time to conduct such training in your organization, you can easily hire an external specialized company that provides cybersecurity training workshops, which will help raise awareness among the organization’s employees in the required manner, regardless of the field of work of your organization and its size. You can get training from RMG and you can request it directly from here.

All employees, at every level of the organization, should receive this training to ensure that they are armed with the skills required to identify an attack when it occurs.

The training will not only educate employees about the set of threats they face internally, but it will also cover the cybersecurity risks they face when working remotely.

Today, remote work has become the norm in light of the pandemic that has affected the world, as we mentioned earlier, but remote work can pose a security risk and may make your organization’s IT network, systems and devices vulnerable to attack.

You should know that cybercriminals will exploit any security vulnerabilities available to them, and the crisis we are experiencing today has provided them with many attractive vulnerabilities that they can exploit.

4. Reliable External Support Solution
With attacks on organizations increasing in number over the past years, organizations need to be able to Respond quickly and effectively to any security incidents you may encounter.

One of the best ways to protect your organization and ensure that it is equipped to deal with a growing range of cybersecurity threats is to have an external cybersecurity support team.

A cybersecurity team is a team of cybersecurity professionals who monitor the organization’s security operations to prevent, detect, and respond to potential threats.

This team tracks security threats, including potential threat notifications across tools, employees, partners, and external sources. The security team will then investigate the threats, and if it is deemed a security incident, they will deal with it quickly and effectively.

If you do not have a security operations center and an expert team in this field, it is time to set it up in your organization. You can also use external companies that provide you with this service and provide you with consultations in this field, such as those provided by Renad Al Majd Information Technology Company (RMG). You can get advice on this topic directly from here.

5. Identify Information Assets and Data Processing Activities
To develop a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy and effectively identify risks, your organization will need to complete a comprehensive audit of your information assets and data processing activities.

This will help identify your most valuable information assets, where they are located, and who has access to that information. Once you have identified these areas, you can focus on how each information asset is likely to be compromised, whether it is a system breach, malware, or even an insider threat. Steps can be taken to improve these processes and reduce the chance of hackers gaining access to critical systems.

Regular audits of data processing activities will help protect data and reduce organizational risk.

6. Develop an incident response plan
As the number of cyberattacks and data breaches continues to rise, your organization is bound to experience a cyberattack at some point. To effectively respond to any incident that may arise, it is important to have a reporting structure in place that enables employees to identify and report incidents in a timely manner.

Reporting a Security ThreatThe ability to report addresses the full scope of incidents that can occur and develop appropriate responses. The policy, processes, and supporting plans should be risk-based and cover any regulatory reporting requirements.

Developing an incident response plan will help educate and inform employees, improve organizational structures, enhance customer and stakeholder confidence, and minimize any potential financial impact following a major incident.

As a cybersecurity manager in an organization, you will be primarily responsible for the consequences of cyber attacks if they succeed. In parallel, you will achieve excellence and success if you prepare an appropriate pre-incident response plan that helps control and recover from that attack or confront it and cause it to fail.

Implementing the cybersecurity practices we mentioned in the article is an urgent need for your organization today. The first step that will make the organization gain the trust of stakeholders and push it towards excellence and success in the business world is having a strong line of defense for that organization against cyber attacks, as well as the organization’s ability to protect its sensitive data and systems.",technical,cybersecurity,

Qualitative research in cybersecurity centers

Friday/Saturday, February 26, 2021
In this article, I do not only seek to show the importance of qualitative research in cybersecurity centers, but I also seek to show the areas of cybersecurity to which qualitative studies are applied, and how cybersecurity centers follow the steps of qualitative research to reach results that have a continuous and future impact.

Shardul Prakash Mohit Shardul P. M. explained that the increase in the number of data and attacks leads to an increase in demand for cybersecurity specialists. The number of cybersecurity jobs is growing at a faster rate than other technology jobs, and it is expected that we will have 3.5 million vacant jobs in the field of cybersecurity by 2021.

From this came the idea of ​​knowing the reason for the increasing interest in cybersecurity and classifying it as one of the jobs of the future after 2020, and researching the reasons behind this, including the trend towards qualitative research, which is called Qualitative research.

First: What is qualitative research?

It is scientific research used in all scientific fields, including: media, political science, social sciences, psychological sciences, educational sciences, health sciences, Sharia sciences, computer sciences, and history.

This qualitative research is based on solving current problems, whether local or global, through human experiences in practical life, using qualitative research tools such as interviews, observation, documents, texts, discourse analysis, artifacts, focus groups, and forms, and using words and phrases that are included in themes and under them a set of codes when analyzing the answers of participants in qualitative research, and qualitative research does not use numbers and statistical programs.

The credit for discovering qualitative research goes to sociologists in British universities and research centers, including Glaser and Strauss, Glaser in 1967 until it has developed now. Then this research began to expand in its scientific methods, including the grounded theory method, which is used in the field of education, the ethnography method, which is used in sociology, the phenomenology method, which is used in psychology and health sciences, the case study method, which is used in education, health care institutions and social development, the documentary method, which is used in the field of research on Islamic sciences, the discourse analysis method, which is now used in the field of research on phenomena and problems in the Department of Media and Political Science, the narrative method, which is now used in health psychology, and the historical method, which is used with big data and enriching the human mind in it.

Second: What are the topics or research areas in cybersecurity with which qualitative research is used?

Researchers study the perceptions and experiences of cybersecurity users, and Steve Morgan and others see the following areas or topics in 2020:

- Data protection topics from external threats iManage Threat Manager

- Cyberattacks, which the World Economic Forum (WEF) classified in 2020 as one of the biggest long-term threats facing the world in its annual risk analysis report.

- The Royal Holloway Center, which was established at the University of London, covers all areas of information and cybersecurity. This center is managed by an elite group of academics and experts in that field. This center prepares qualitative research in cybersecurity in the field of encryption and its applications, system security, and infrastructure protection. The center applies social theory to cybersecurity.

- Viruses: A replicating program that spreads throughout a computer system, infecting files with malicious code.

- Trojan horses: A type of malware that hides in the form of positive programs. Cybercriminals trick users into downloading Trojans onto their computers where they can damage or collect data.

- Spyware: A program that secretly records what a user does, enabling cybercriminals to take advantage of this information. For example, spyware can capture credit card details.

- Ransomware: A malicious program that locks a user’s files and data, threatening to erase them unless a ransom is paid.

- Adware: An advertising program that can be used to spread malware.

- Botnets: A network of computers infected with malware that cybercriminals use to perform tasks online without the user’s permission.

- Firewalls: A defense system for any network that keeps its systems and devices, from internet connections safe from external threats such as viruses.

Third: What is the relationship between qualitative research and cybersecurity?

There is no doubt that there is a deep relationship between qualitative research and cybersecurity. After the spread of the Covid-19 virus, British universities have become more and more interested in qualitative research rather than quantitative research. We notice an increase in qualitative research in higher education institutions and research centers in France in the current situation; The reason may be due to the effectiveness of addressing contemporary problems through in-depth face-to-face interviews with officials in scientific research centers for cybersecurity in advanced European countries. In Japan, we notice that workers in cybersecurity centers are those who have Japanese citizenship and reside in the country. Bernd Steinkühler says, “We must be honest. Hackers challenge us every day, and there is no 100% security level. Every system has a weak point, no matter how well it is built. However, cybersecurity companies have focused on Designing and applying qualitative approaches to cybersecurity research, which fall under the term Qualitative Approaches to Cybersecurity Research.

Therefore, Katie Shilton, an assistant professor at the University of Maryland College Park, pointed out

that researchers need to develop qualitative research methods for cybersecurity fields to achieve knowledge that includes human-computer interaction (HCI), digital and information. Digital literacy, information and technology policy, and technology engineering ethics, using qualitative methods; linking these fields to cybersecurity will lead to a deep improvement in our understanding of humans. This is done by using the multiple case study approach in qualitative research and conducting interviews.

Qualitative research attempts to reach advanced solutions for protecting sensitive data through iManage Threat Manager technology by conducting interviews or focus groups with customers and managers of cybersecurity companies.

“Cybersecurity companies use qualitative research data in the industry when developing new products, and it is driven by a group of professionals who are familiar with qualitative research methods, tools, and analysis,” says Joanna Jones, CEO of InterQ Research.

“For global market research to be successful, cybersecurity analysts and security leaders must be prepared to play their part in engaging in qualitative research,” she adds.

At the 4th International Cybersecurity Conference in August 2019, Damjan Fujs argues that qualitative research has ways to explain cybersecurity. Cybersecurity is a vital topic that has spread among researchers in countries that care about cybersecurity. Qualitative research on cybersecurity was conducted through interviews with cybersecurity programmers and managers. The qualitative research revealed that there are different areas of cybersecurity, including: personal cybersecurity, organizational cybersecurity, and state (national) cybersecurity. The most common and most widely used qualitative approaches in the field of cybersecurity are case studies through interviews, observations and focus groups.

The official website of the US Department of Commerce indicated that Japan is one of the advanced countries that has distinguished itself in qualitative research for cybersecurity centers, as the size of the information security market was $ 9.8 billion in 2017, and reached $ 10.7 billion in 2018. It formed the National Cybersecurity Strategy (NISC) in 2019.

The CybersecurityResearch Institute (CybersecurityResearch Institute) at NICT in Japan is prominent in research and development on cyberattack monitoring and analysis technologies. Qualitative research deals with cryptographic technology to develop its work and scientifically address its problems and protect data privacy, and in providing technical support.

In terms of scientific papers based on qualitative research, researchers at Stanford University, led by David Mazieres, an associate professor of computer science at Stanford University, have turned to creating operating systems that work as security that enables malicious codes to prevent the leakage of private user data, by preparing scientific papers based on qualitative research.

The Royal Holloway Center, which was established at the University of London, works on all areas of information and cybersecurity. This center is managed by an elite group of academics and experts in that field. This center prepares qualitative research in cybersecurity in the field of encryption and its applications, systems security, and applies social theory to cybersecurity and infrastructure protection.

Despite spending billions of dollars each A year after securing network infrastructure, devices, and resources against cyber threats, the impact of cybersecurity research on individuals remains largely unstudied. The populations that need cybersecurity include children, teens, adults, and families; to avoid risks.

Qualitative methods are a particularly important and rigorous way to understand and explore these phenomena. However, qualitative research is only a small part of cybersecurity research Cybersecurity

Therefore, qualitative ways of knowing must be explored in cybersecurity research, as Creswell argues in his 2002 book Research Design: Qualitative, Quantitative, and Mixed Methods.

As Patton argues in his 2001 book Qualitative Research Methods and Evaluation (3rd Edition). Joanna Jones, CEO of InterQ Research, says that cybersecurity companies can use qualitative research data and input from industry professionals when developing new products.

InterQ is headquartered in San Francisco and aims to help clients gain insight into customer needs through market research.

Joanna Jones wrote in an article for CPO Magazine that e-commerce vendors rely heavily on quantitative research that generally covers different business sizes to help them understand what types of platforms consumers are looking for.

Jones noted that vendors should also work with market researchers who can facilitate focus groups or interview CISOs and security professionals.

“For market research to be successful, security analysts and security leaders need to be willing to participate in the studies and provide their input and roles,” she said.

She also noted that qualitative methods will allow companies to deliver offerings that are tailored to real-world customer environments.

As an applied example of how qualitative research can be used in cybersecurity, Jones noted that Susanne M. Furman, while working on cybersecurity and trust issues, quickly realized that the quantitative tools she was most comfortable with were inadequate for analyzing this type of data. A study participant responded as follows:

“It doesn’t seem like a big security risk to me. I don’t work for the State Department and I don’t send sensitive information in email. If you want to steal my email, I make blueberry pancakes on the weekend. If you need to, steal it.”

From the study participant’s response, we can see that the researcher or group of researchers are aware of qualitative research methods and that qualitative research tools are important and valuable for collecting and analyzing data in the field of cybersecurity.

Conclusion

There is no doubt that quantitative research has a significant contribution to addressing cybersecurity issues, and it is more widespread than qualitative research, whose profound contributions to addressing cybersecurity issues have not been discovered until recently, especially with the repercussions of the Covid-19 crisis, which has proven that quantitative research alone is not sufficient to address the problems of qualitative research.",technical,cybersecurity,
" Cybersecurity is defined as the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. These attacks are typically intended to access, alter, or destroy sensitive information, extort money from users, or disrupt business operations.

Cybersecurity Approach

Successful cybersecurity takes a specific approach that typically consists of multiple layers of protection spread across the computers, networks, programs, or data that one intends to keep safe. In any organization, users, processes, and technology must complement each other and work together to create an effective defense against cyber attacks.

Users

Users must understand and comply with basic data security principles such as choosing strong passwords, being wary of attachments from unknown sources in email, and making sure to back up data.

Technology

Technology is essential to give organizations and individuals the tools they need to protect themselves from cyber attacks.

Three main entities that must be protected:

-Computers, smart devices, and routers.

-Networks.

-The cloud.

Common technologies used to protect these entities include firewalls, DNS filtering, malware, antivirus software, and email security solutions.

Why Cybersecurity Matters

In our networked world, everyone benefits from cyber defense programs. On an individual level, a cybersecurity attack can lead to identity theft, extortion attempts, or the loss of important data such as family photos. Communities also rely on critical infrastructure such as power plants, hospitals, and financial services companies, so securing these and other organizations is essential to keeping our society running safely and normally.",technical,cybersecurity,
" Cybersecurity challenges are increasing with the advancement of technology, especially with the development of artificial intelligence. This is due to the fact that AI may contribute to enhancing the capabilities of cyber attacks and making them more sophisticated and complex, while it can also be used to enhance the capabilities of confronting these threats on the other hand, as a double-edged sword.

One of the positive aspects of artificial intelligence technologies in dealing with advanced cyber threats is that these technologies - especially those related to data analysis - can contribute to discovering unusual patterns and suspicious behavior in cyber networks, which can help in early detection of potential attacks. Automatic response technology can also be effective in reducing the impact of cyber attacks, by developing systems that automatically isolate affected systems to prevent the spread of attacks.

In today's interconnected and digital world, the rapid development of technology has brought unprecedented opportunities and daunting challenges. One of the most pressing challenges in this digital age is the escalating development of cyber threats, which are now exacerbated by the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into various aspects of our lives. As AI continues to advance, it has become imperative to explore how technology can effectively interact with and counter these advanced cyber threats.",technical,cybersecurity,
" How can personal data be protected in a constantly connected world?

Our digital devices are exposed to a range of risks, such as technical failures, data loss, theft, and hacking; that's why we must adopt correct security practices and develop a plan to protect documents, which may help us secure them. It is necessary to learn about cybersecurity, challenges, and solutions in the age of technology, but before that, we will talk about how to protect personal data; through:

First: Securing devices and networks

One of the most important topics is securing devices and networks; therefore, in order to protect personal data, several things must be done, namely:

1. Physical security:
It means securing the device and network in a paid manner and preventing anyone from directly accessing it, limiting the possibility of connecting an external disk to the computer to copy the entire hard drive, or transferring malware that enables a thief to access your network and data.

2. Software updates:
Updating the operating system and applications helps to periodically correct problems and vulnerabilities and run automatic updates to protect our systems and applications, which contributes to securing and reducing system vulnerabilities, and this is called cybersecurity, or electronic security.

3. Combating malware:
Due to the constant connection to the Internet and sharing our data across different sites or applications, we face the possibility of our devices being hacked by malicious programs, so it becomes necessary to equip devices with anti-virus and anti-thief tools, such as anti-virus programs.

These programs have the ability to detect viruses and intruders and prevent them from causing damage to devices; therefore, it is necessary to scan devices using anti-virus and anti-spyware programs.

4. Activating the device management and remote scanning feature:
This feature allows the user to access the device remotely, and the ability to locate devices in case of theft, erase them and lock them, such as Find my iPhone in IOS systems.

Second: Taking a backup copy of the data
Taking a backup copy of the data is an essential process in the field of cybersecurity and information protection. This process allows the user to create a copy of his information and refer to it in the event that the device is damaged, lost, stolen, or even hacked. This process can be implemented in several ways, including:

1. Offline backup:
This method is the process of making a backup copy of the data on an external device such as an external disk drive or flash drive, and storing it in a safe place.

2. Online cloud backup:
This type of backup is the ideal solution due to the valuable features it offers, such as ease of use, ease of access, and the ability to transfer data to a remote location. However, it should be noted that these services are a target for thieves; therefore, it is necessary to implement backup security practices such as data encryption, using strong passwords, and activating the multi-authentication feature.

These services may be free or for a subscription fee, and are provided by several companies such as (iCloud), (Google Drive), (OneDrive), (Amazon) and others.

Third: Data Protection

It is necessary to focus on securing devices and networks, and developing a backup plan to protect data, as these procedures increase the level of security and reduce the risk of data loss or tampering. However, protecting very important data should receive special attention from you, as storing data in a safe place on the device or external storage unit or even on the cloud requires continuous attention, and it must be understood that these steps do not mean preventing potential leakage or hacking.

Information protection requires additional levels of protection such as:

1. Data encryption:
This type provides an additional level of cybersecurity and information protection, as it is done by encrypting the local hard drive or external storage devices or data stored on the cloud, and this procedure protects your data even if it is stolen or accessed without permission.

2. Granting minimum access:
When you share your computer or information with others, give them the minimum access they need to a specific document or application to perform the task assigned to them. This prevents them from changing or tampering with documents that they should not have access to.

3. Wiping your old device:
This method is one of the procedures that must be done when replacing an old phone. It is necessary to get rid of old data and make sure to empty the memory by performing a factory reset. However, it is possible to recover data using the appropriate skills and tools. To prevent the recovery of old files, you must enter new incorrect data, edit the old file and save it again.

The latest technologies and strategies for cybersecurity:

The world has recently witnessed several attacks on vital infrastructure such as healthcare sectors, water systems and electricity networks. With the advancement of new technologies that enable systems and networks to be hacked quickly, experts are working to provide the latest technologies and strategies for cybersecurity.

1. Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning:
There has been a lot of talk recently about artificial intelligence. This application can be described as working in a way similar to the two-factor authentication process. Two-factor authentication relies on verifying the user's identity by using unique information that is known only to users. In addition, artificial intelligence is used to add additional touches and ideas; This is done through analysis and information in the verification and auditing process. This is done by using deep learning techniques to analyze data in records, transactions and interactions in real time to detect threats or unusual activities.

2. Behavioral Analytics: Behavioral analytics helps identify types of system and network activities to detect potential cyber threats in real time. For example, an unusual increase in data transfer from a particular device could indicate a potential cybersecurity issue. Although behavior analytics is typically used to assess networks, it has seen increasing application in user systems and devices.

3. Embedded Device Authentication:
Using a PIN and password is no longer enough to secure devices. Embedded authentication tools are a new development in verifying the identity of the connected user.

Intel has made significant progress in this area by introducing the sixth generation vPro chips. These strong user authentication chips are integrated into the device itself. These systems are designed to revolutionize the field of (authentication security). These chips rely on multiple levels and methods to verify identity, making them one of the most important cybersecurity technologies.

4. Blockchain Cybersecurity:
Blockchain cybersecurity is one of the latest cybersecurity technologies that has gained popularity and appreciation from users. Blockchain technology works on the principle of identification between the two parties to the transaction. Similarly, blockchain cybersecurity works on the principle of peer-to-peer network fundamentals of Blockchain cybersecurity technology.

Each member of Blockchain cybersecurity is responsible for verifying the validity of the added data. In addition, blockchain technology creates a network that is almost impenetrable to hackers, making it one of the best protection technologies at present to protect data from any breach. Therefore, when Blockchain cybersecurity is used with artificial intelligence, it can create a strong verification system to keep potential cyber threats at bay.

5. Zero Trust Model:
This cybersecurity model assumes that the network is highly vulnerable to threats, and believes that it is necessary not to rely on the network completely, so it becomes clear that internal and external guarantees must be strengthened, and it is necessary to protect internal and external networks at the same level, including identifying data that is highly important to the business, mapping the flow of this data, and segmenting it logically and physically, in addition to implementing policies and intensive monitoring through automation and continuous monitoring.

" As ChatGPT sweeps the world as the latest large language model (LLM) and a model for creative artificial intelligence (Generative AI), there is an increasing quest to learn how to benefit from its advantages, as well as how to avoid its drawbacks and conduct a risk assessment as a powerful technical tool with potential risks; therefore, the following security considerations must be considered when using it:

1. Training mechanism:

Last April, a controversy began in the European Union about ChatGPT’s processing of personal data for the purposes of training the program within the deep learning technology, without a legal basis governing its use. For its part, OpenAI, the company that designed the program, confirms that it relies on open sources on the Internet to train it; however, this argument did not seem convincing enough given that the presence of data on public sources does not mean that it is available to everyone without conditions, in addition to the fact that the program does not obtain any permissions to use sensitive personal data. However, the company responded to these claims and decided to cancel the feature of saving previous chats.

Another problem related to training is the possibility of users intentionally misleading the program by feeding it incorrect data and information, which affects the application's performance and poses a security risk to its databases.

2. Questions:

Another potential breach of corporate security is providing the program with sensitive or confidential data to direct specific questions to the program about it, which poses a risk to making this data available in ChatGPT's databases and then potentially using it with other users; therefore, it is recommended that companies whose employees need ChatGPT services resort to special versions of it that are used exclusively for the company to ensure the confidentiality of their data.

3. Responses:

Like any non-human tool, ChatGPT does not have a sense of what can and cannot be disclosed, and does not yet include rules that define this matter; therefore, its unrestricted answers pose a risk if malicious parties exploit it by asking questions about sensitive data of individuals or institutions, such as personal identification numbers or bank account data that may be found in the program's databases.",technical,cybersecurity,
" Trend Micro, a global cybersecurity company, has released its annual Cybersecurity Predictions Report for 2025. The report reveals the rise of AI-powered cyberattacks, with threats emerging that use deep fake technology to match the victim’s behavior.

The report stated that cybercrimes could cost more than $10 trillion by 2025, with consumer data remaining the primary target. It also indicated that criminals will continue to develop their methods of exploiting vulnerabilities, relying on artificial intelligence to accelerate and improve their malicious operations, especially in implementing social engineering strategies that exploit human vulnerabilities.

The report predicted the emergence of “malicious digital twin” technology, which is a digital copy of a real entity, based on leaked personal data to create virtual AI characters that mimic human behavior. When combined with deep fake biometric data technologies, it can be used to carry out complex social fraud operations such as hacking business email, impersonating employees, and disinformation campaigns.

The 2025 Cybersecurity Predictions report underscores the company’s commitment to enhancing digital security, a commitment that is clearly evident in the company’s 2024 semi-annual report, which highlighted Trend Micro’s success in detecting and repelling more than 188 million cyber threats in the Middle East and North Africa region in the first six months of last year. “Understanding cybersecurity trends in an AI-driven world is a priority for organizations looking to protect their systems from advanced threats,” said Bilal Beg, Trend Micro’s CTO for the Mediterranean, Middle East, and Africa. “We aim to provide organizations with strategic insights that enhance their ability to adapt to the rapid changes in the field of digital security, relying on the insights of the past to guide our steps towards the future, and we will continue our unwavering commitment to empowering companies and individuals with the knowledge and tools needed to overcome the challenges of the cybersecurity landscape.” In Saudi Arabia alone, we have successfully blocked over 11 million email threats and thwarted 21 million malware attacks during the first half of 2024, reflecting our proactive approach to protecting the region’s digital environment.” The report also addressed risks related to system vulnerabilities, such as vulnerabilities resulting from memory corruption, and exploiting API vulnerabilities, along with threats such as cross-site malware injection, database injection, and cyber risks related to electronic control units in internet-connected vehicles. The report also warned of the rise of ransomware attacks targeting cloud environments and Internet of Things devices.",technical,cybersecurity,

As we mentioned earlier, cybersecurity is a periodic practice to defend devices, servers, and systems from malicious and harmful attacks that aim to steal, manipulate, or destroy data. Cybersecurity works to secure networks, for example, from any external intrusion that aims to attack the network. Its importance also lies in protecting the security of applications on computers from any threats that enable the hacker to access data through loopholes in the application and sneak in secretly and steal data, as the presence of strong and effective protection systems is essential to protect devices from any malicious programs.

In addition, as an individual user or as a government organization, the security of the integrity and privacy of data when transferred or stored is one of the priorities that require raising security to maintain its confidentiality and integrity. We do not limit ourselves to saying that cybersecurity does not include operational security, as operational security works with data assets and ensures their protection, such as granting permits to authorized persons and permissions when accessing the network, and also determining the locations of data storage and sharing.

One of the most important requirements of cybersecurity is how organizations or institutions respond to any unpredictable emergency security incident that may cause data loss and the mechanism of the institution's work in recovering its data and operations, and developing appropriate plans in order to ensure business continuity and return to the same operational capacity before the incident.

Cybersecurity Objectives:
Cybersecurity generally aims to enhance the protection of all electronic transactions or individuals related to the state in order to maintain the integrity of all technical systems and all their components of devices, software and equipment from any external interference that poses a threat and danger to the confidentiality, integrity and safety of information, data.

You may know what cyber attacks may leave behind in terms of major blackmail problems and scandals for victims of Internet users due to hacking their mobile phones.

What are the areas of cyber security and what is the danger of cyber attacks?

Perhaps the most prominent areas of cybersecurity are defined in the following matters:

Phishing
This is the process of sending fraudulent emails similar to emails, but they are from trusted sources, and the goal is to steal personal and sensitive information such as login information and bank account card numbers. This is one of the most common cyber attacks, and you can protect yourself by educating yourself in this aspect, and using technical solutions that help you filter your emails.

Ransomware
This type of program is a virus that is sent to your device with the aim of harming it, and such programs are designed for the purpose of financial extortion, to request money by cutting off access to your personal files on your device or phone.

Malware
This is malicious software designed to gain unauthorized access to your computer to harm and destroy it.

Social engineering
This is a method used for eavesdropping, in which you are lured into revealing your confidential information. They can then demand a ransom, or threaten to publish this data or images, and this method is done by sending untrusted links and urging you to click on them, and after clicking, your device is hacked and controlled.

After we learned about cybersecurity and cyber attacks and what are the most prominent areas of cybersecurity, it is necessary to know where the importance of cybersecurity lies.

" I don't think - in our current era - that a day goes by without us using technology, whether for education, communication with others, banking or government transactions, or even ordering pizza! The presence of applications and internet connection have become basic requirements for living in our time. The digital transformation has included all sectors and different areas of life, whether in government agencies, banks, hospitals, or commercial transactions. Manual transactions have moved to electronic, then to automated software; in fact, progress has reached the point where this automation has become smart and suitable for the user's requirements and achieves the organization's goals effectively by applying artificial intelligence models to it. But we usually do not feel the amount of work that goes on behind the scenes of applications, operating systems and networks, as all systems go through a series of verification steps that ensure the integrity of data, applications and their infrastructure, and there is a set of applied standards and systems that are concerned with maintaining the confidentiality of data and applying encryption mechanisms and protocols necessary for its safe transmission between devices, networks and applications, and we do not imagine that the service will be disrupted for many of the sites and applications that we are accustomed to, as there are many measures followed to ensure the availability of these applications even in the event of a cyber attack on them or even when the power is cut off.

Therefore, it is the responsibility of the user - whether he has a technical background or not - to raise his technical awareness and apply safe practices while using technology, whatever it may be, and this is achieved by knowing the most famous hacking methods that are developing rapidly globally and protecting himself from them, and perhaps the financial fraud attacks that we have witnessed recently and their dire consequences were the biggest wake-up call for all of us to pay attention to our data and not share it with others.

If we go back to the applications that we use daily, the means that makes us rely on them, enable them and develop them is to apply cybersecurity in a professional manner, in two aspects: the first is to build these applications and technologies on solid scientific foundations that reduce the chances of hacking them, which is called Security by Design, which seeks to close known loopholes and prepare for and reduce risks, and the second is to educate users on the ways to use these applications safely, so that they are not a reason for us to abandon the technology due to the large number of attacks on it.

So when you decide to request a delivery car through the application, and pay for it with the credit card that you filled through the bank application, and you are carrying with you goods that you have just purchased from an online store application, after you requested a service to repair your broken-down car on the road through an application, remember that cybersecurity is what made you rely on these technologies and trust them!",technical,cybersecurity,
" Working from home has become a significant weapon in our fight against the coronavirus. However, remote work also presents an opportunity for skilled cybercriminals and hackers. In 2021, we can expect cybercriminals and hackers to refine their attack strategies and adapt to the “work from home” phenomenon, going after employees even more than they did in 2020.

Unmanaged home machines will become targets and, therefore, easily hackable, and devices in the home will become the focal point for corporate devices connected to the home, enabling advanced persistent attacks. As a result, we can expect to see a continued decline in the use of VPN technology as a trusted extension of the corporate network, and cybersecurity technologies will continue to move away from edge and network applications to endpoint protection.

These changes are likely to cause a significant increase in demand for technology that was previously reserved for trained cybersecurity personnel, and cybersecurity providers will respond to the change.

Companies will begin to converge and offer software solutions for the changing workplace, and more advanced technology will be released to the market. Services such as web filtering, intrusion detection, and more sophisticated endpoint protection will also grow in the consumer market. Amid the ongoing cybersecurity skills gap, there will also be a growing demand for enterprise cybersecurity professionals and experts.

“Security and privacy by design” will be at risk as hackers and cybercriminals continue to target the healthcare and financial industries.

The rapid deployment of technology in the healthcare sector to manage tracking and tracing programs, vaccine logistics, mobile apps, and other activities will lead to examples of software that does not adhere to the “security and privacy by design” philosophy.

This bias is also likely to be the cause of widespread privacy breaches, putting patients and their data at risk. Combined with ransomware, we may see the first government held to ransom by hackers demanding payment for decryption or issuing data leak threats.

As the COVID-19 pandemic has caused a spike in online banking, we can expect a rise in phishing, phishing, and identity theft attacks on consumers and businesses.

– “Schrems II” will continue to impact multinational tech companies

In July 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union overturned the EU-US ruling. The Privacy Shield framework was upheld by the EU’s standard contractual clauses. This was for the transfer of personal data to processors outside the EU/EEA in Case C-311/18 Data Protection Commissioner v. Facebook Ireland Limited and Maximillian Schrems (known as “Schrems II”).

The EU-US ruling means that the Privacy Shield framework is an inadequate mechanism to ensure compliance with EU data protection requirements. This will have a significant impact on privacy provisions and requirements between countries.

In 2021, we will continue to see multinational tech companies impacted by these privacy provisions, increasing the need to strengthen privacy protections and invest in more sophisticated cybersecurity measures.

– Ransomware is a winning factor for cybercriminals and hackers

Cybercriminals and hackers are driven by money; so as long as it is economically beneficial to them, ransomware cases will continue to rise. Today’s cybercriminals and hackers are creative, capable, and opportunistic, so they will continue to expand their repertoire of ransomware techniques.

In 2021, ransomware attacks will not only include ransom demands, but also threats of data exfiltration and leakage.

These dual-threat attacks will reduce disaster recovery and business continuity mitigation assessments for ransomware protection in most risk assessments.

Since organizations will be more likely to pay hackers and cybercriminals, governments must take tough action against those who pay off sanctioned criminal entities.",technical,cybersecurity,
" The Information and Decision Support Center of the Cabinet highlighted the report issued by the World Economic Forum entitled ""Global Cybersecurity Outlook 2025"".

The report issued by the World Economic Forum entitled ""Global Cybersecurity Outlook 2025"" addresses the increasing complexity of the cyber landscape and its profound impacts on institutions and countries, and indicates that this complexity is not limited to technical aspects only, but also includes economic and social dimensions that require a comprehensive and integrated response.

The report, issued by the World Economic Forum, entitled “Global Cybersecurity Predictions 2025,” explained that the factors contributing to the complexity of the cyber landscape are geopolitical tensions, complex supply chains, emerging technologies, regulatory requirements, and a lack of skills. International conflicts and tensions increase uncertainty and make cyber attacks a tool in these conflicts, as governments, critical infrastructure, and economies are targeted, while reliance on interconnected supply chains leads to the emergence of vulnerabilities that can be exploited. These risks are increased by the lack of transparency and oversight of supplier security. In addition, the rapid adoption of technologies such as artificial intelligence contributes to the emergence of new security vulnerabilities, which cybercriminals exploit to enhance their attack methods, while the proliferation of different laws and regulations around the world may increase the burden on organizations that find it difficult to comply with them.

The report issued by the World Economic Forum entitled ""Global Cybersecurity Predictions 2025"" added that the shortage of specialized skills in cybersecurity contributes to the exacerbation of the situation, as many organizations lack the necessary competencies to manage cyber risks.

The report issued by the World Economic Forum entitled ""Global Cybersecurity Predictions 2025"" indicated that the effects of this complexity are represented in several points, including:

- Exacerbating cyber disparities: As increasing complexity increases the gap between large and small organizations, developed and developing countries, and small organizations struggle to secure themselves, while large organizations advance steadily.

- The evolution of cyber attacks: The number of cyber attacks is increasing and their methods are evolving, especially with the use of artificial intelligence by cybercriminals, making ransomware, fraud and phishing attacks more prevalent.

-Risks to critical infrastructure: Critical infrastructure has become an increasing target for cyber attacks, jeopardizing public safety and national security.

-Risks in biotechnology: Developments in these areas lead to the emergence of new risks that require advanced security measures, as attacks can disrupt research or compromise sensitive data.

The Information and Decision Support Center confirmed that the report stated that in response to these challenges, artificial intelligence can be exploited in defense, as the security of artificial intelligence tools must be assessed before deployment, and artificial intelligence can enhance defense capabilities by quickly detecting and responding to risks. Institutions must also adopt a comprehensive approach to risk management, focusing on identifying and assessing risks and implementing preventive measures, as well as enhancing cooperation, as cooperation between the public and private sectors and between different countries should be enhanced to confront cross-border cyber threats, with a focus on exchanging information and threats.

The Information Center reviewed a number of recommendations resulting from the forum to enhance the quality of cybersecurity and avoid the resulting risks, through:

-Investing in cybersecurity: Cybersecurity should be considered a strategic investment and not just an expense, with the necessary resources allocated to enhance defense capabilities.

-Skill development: Emphasis should be placed on developing skills in the field of cybersecurity, especially skills related to artificial intelligence.

-Raising awareness: Awareness of the importance of cybersecurity should be raised throughout society, with all employees needing to understand cyber risks and participate in promoting a culture of security.

-Preparing for the future: Prepare for future threats by initiating risk assessments and implementing preventive measures.

The report concluded that the cyber landscape is complex and constantly changing, requiring a rapid and integrated response from all stakeholders. Therefore, institutions and countries must work together to enhance cyber resilience, protect critical infrastructure, and ensure data and information security.",technical,cybersecurity,
"  Cyberattacks have evolved at an unprecedented rate, with artificial intelligence playing a major role in enhancing the effectiveness of phishing attacks. According to a recent study by Kaspersky, 49% of respondents reported experiencing phishing incidents in the past months, while the company warned of the increasing use of artificial intelligence in developing techniques for these attacks, which puts even the most knowledgeable employees at risk.

Unprecedentedly Intelligent Personalization of Attacks

Phishing attacks no longer rely on random messages, but artificial intelligence has enabled the precise personalization of messages, targeting individuals based on their data available online. Artificial intelligence can craft messages that appear completely personalized, making them more difficult to detect. For example, a fraudulent message may be sent to the CFO that appears to be from the company’s CEO, and relates to a recent internal topic, easily trapping the recipient.

“Deepfake” as a New Weapon

In addition to personalized messages, “deepfake” technology has become a dangerous tool in the hands of attackers, as it is used to imitate the voices and images of real people. In one documented incident, this technique was used to convince an employee to transfer millions of dollars, which highlights the seriousness of these attacks and the difficulty they are detectable even by experts.

How to counter them?

To counter these sophisticated attacks, Kaspersky advises companies to adopt multiple defense strategies, including regular training of employees to detect phishing threats and the use of advanced security technologies capable of detecting unusual patterns.

" The new AI assistant DeepSeek has gained widespread attention in recent days, making it the target of fraudulent activity discovered by experts from Russian cybersecurity company Kaspersky.

The company warned that cybercriminals are exploiting the technical confusion that accompanied the spread of the tool, as fake registration pages appeared with the aim of stealing user data.

Security threats associated with DeepSeek
The alleged cyberattack on DeepSeek has led to problems registering accounts on the application and the official website, as many users fail to complete the registration process.

Criminals are exploiting this situation by creating fraudulent websites that ask users to enter their email and passwords, allowing the theft of credentials and the possibility of using them to hack other accounts, especially if the user reuses the same password across multiple services.

Fraudulent cryptocurrencies
In addition, new cryptocurrencies have emerged that exploit the hype surrounding DeepSeek, and are being offered for sale despite not being affiliated with the company. The risk is that these coins have no real value and are used as a means to trick users who want to invest in them, which can lead to huge financial losses.

Open source software risks
Leonid Bezverchenko, a security researcher at Kaspersky’s Global Research and Analysis Team (GReAT), commented that DeepSeek’s open source nature makes it vulnerable to security and ethical risks, as criminals can exploit this transparency to create hacked versions of the tool or install backdoors via tools that manipulate its API.

Bezverchenko added that open source software exploitation was one of the most prominent cyber threats in 2023, noting that more than 12,000 malicious packages were discovered in open software repositories during 2024, reflecting the danger of the lack of centralized oversight of such tools.

Tips for protecting user data
To address these risks, several tips should be followed to protect user data from DeepSeek-related fraud:

Check website addresses before entering login data, and do not enter passwords on suspicious sites.

Use strong and unique passwords, and rely on a password manager to keep them safe.

Activate two-factor authentication (2FA) whenever available, to enhance account security.

Use reliable security solutions to protect devices from hacking and malware.",technical,cybersecurity,
" The high tech sector is often ground zero for cyber-attacks. One obvious reason is that these organizations have very valuable information to be stolen. However, another more subtle reason is the nature of high tech organizations themselves. High tech companies – and their employees – generally have a higher risk appetite than their counterparts in other sectors. Also, they tend to be early adopters of new technologies that are still maturing and are therefore especially vulnerable to attacks and exploits. For example, employees in high-tech are more likely to use (and self-administer) cutting-edge mobile devices and the latest mobile apps, which might not be secure. In addition, many high-tech organizations have open environments and corporate cultures that are designed to stimulate creativity and collaboration, but are more difficult to defend. As a result, high-tech organizations typically have a very large attack surface to protect.

Just as important, some parts of the high-tech sector provide an attack path into other sectors, since high-tech products are a key infrastructure component for all kinds of organizations. Technology is a key enabler, but it can also be a key source of vulnerability. For example, because of the tremendous need to establish trust on the internet, attacks on certificate authorities have caused serious privacy breaches across a number of industries (case #1). Also, vulnerabilities in point-of-sale systems have led to major security breaches for retailers, and back doors in communication hardware have exposed organizations in every sector to a wide range of attacks.

Speaking of back doors, the growing involvement of covert state actors in this area has been making headlines recently, causing serious reputational damage for the organizations involved.

For companies in the high-tech sector, one of the biggest threats is loss of intellectual property (IP). Having IP lost or stolen after years of investment can dramatically reduce an organization’s competitive advantage (case #2, which involved both IP and personal information). States and competitors are often the actors in IP theft; however, insiders are also a major threat. A single highly skilled insider with the right kind of access can quickly make off with huge amounts of valuable data.

Since many high-tech companies also offer online services, loss of customer information is another major threat that is highly visible, since many countries require disclosure when personal identifiable information is lost. However, IP theft might actually be more prevalent. It’s hard to know for sure based on media coverage since there is generally no requirement to disclose lost IP.

Hacktivism is another significant threat in this sector. High-tech companies create products that technically savvy people are keen to “hack” in the original sense of the word, which means using something for a purpose other than what it was designed for. Organizations that prosecute or sue people for this type of “hacking” may find themselves targeted by hacktivist groups, which can lead to great financial losses and reputation damage (case #3).

Fraudulent certificates lead to bankruptcy and a national security breach
Organization
A certificate authority that signs security certificates for organizations globally.

Scenario
The internet is based on trust and certificate authorities are at the heart of this trust. Hackers with ties to a foreign government obtained illegal access to the certificate authority’s servers and used it to generate fraudulent security certificates. These certificates were then used to enable fraudulent servers posing as the original servers belonging to highly used web services. This allowed the attackers to perform man-in-the-middle attacks, possibly intercepting and decrypting a tremendous amount of confidential communications.

Attackers and motivation
The individual who claimed the attack said he was driven by political beliefs. However, the way the fraudulent certificates were used and the fact that the attack took place over a relatively long period of time suggests state actors were also involved.

Techniques used
Apart from known hacker tools, some very complex attack scripts were used that were specifically developed to attack the certificate authority in question.

Business impact
The hackers generated more than 500 fraudulent certificates, which were then used to perform man-in-the-middle attacks against many well-known global services. The certificate authority could not guarantee revocation of the fraudulent certificates, which was completely unacceptable given that the organization’s sole reason for existence is to provide certification that is 100% trustworthy. The certificate authority declared bankruptcy shortly after the breach was made public.


Case 1

Leading software company loses face – along with customer data and source code
Organization
A large software vendor that sells software globally, with more than $1 billion in annual revenue.

Scenario
Hackers infiltrated the company’s network and downloaded more than 100 million encrypted user credentials, along with credit card information for millions of customers. In addition, the source code for a number of key products was stolen.

Attackers and motivation
No one has claimed the attack and information about the attackers is not publicly known. However, given the type of information stolen, it is likely this was the work of an organized group of cybercriminals aiming to use the stolen credentials for identity theft, and to sell the stolen source code for financial gain. Also, since the stolen source code was for a widely used application, it’s possible that the application itself will be used as an attack vector, since finding vulnerabilities is much easier with the source code in hand.

Techniques used
The company’s Chief Security Officer described the attack as “sophisticated”. Other than that, no details have been made public.

Business impact
This story made global headlines, dealing a severe blow to the company’s reputation -- especially since people expect better security practices from a software vendor. The company had to require more than 100 million users to change their passwords, and offered a large portion of their customers a year of free credit monitoring.

Case 2

Vengeful hacktivists force a leading online platform to shut down for more than a month
Organization
A very large technology company that sells products all around the world and operates a popular online platform.

Scenario
The online platform, which has millions of users, was attacked by a hacktivist group with a grudge against the company. The hackers managed to steal more than 70 million user names and passwords, as well as credit card information in multiple attacks spanning months. In the wake of the attack, the company was forced to temporarily shut down its online service, denying access to users for more than a month.

Attackers and motivation
Prior to the attack, the company had made some decisions in a public case that did not sit well with a particular group of clever hackers. This hacktivist group sought revenge by hitting the company with a very impactful attack.

Techniques used
The initial attack vector the hackers used to infiltrate the company’s network is not publicly known. What is known however is that the attackers spent a long time in the company’s internal network. During this time they discovered a number of vulnerabilities that could be easily exploited. Most likely they used a SQL injection attack against the online platform’s internet-facing servers to steal data from sensitive databases.

Business impact
The company lost personal and credit card information for more than 70 million users. Also, because the attackers were so deeply nested in the internal network, the company decided to close down the online platform for multiple months resulting in major financial losses. Customers were later compensated for the downtime, costing the company even more money. What’s more, the breach was reported in the news globally, badly damaging the organization’s reputation.",technical,cybersecurity,

" Abstract
While technical controls can reduce vulnerabilities to cyber threats, no technology provides absolute protection and we hypothesised that people may act less securely if they place unwarranted trust in these automated systems. This paper describes the development of a Trust in Technical Controls Scale (TTCS) that measures people's faith in four of these technical controls. In an online study (N = 607), Australian employees demonstrated a greater degree of trust in firewalls and anti-virus software than they did in spam filters and social media privacy settings. Lower scores on the four item TTCS were related to better information security awareness (ISA) and higher scores on tests of cognitive abilities such as non-verbal IQ and cognitive reflection. The TTCS predicted an individual's ability to detect a phishing email to a similar degree as other factors such as ISA, non-verbal IQ and cognitive impulsivity. However, unlike ISA, the scale did not predict the strength of passwords people constructed. Results suggest that the TTCS is a useful complement to ISA in understanding and predicting certain cyber security behaviours.
Introduction
One of the most common factors contributing to incidents that undermine the security of an organisation's information system is the behaviour of employees (Alavi, and Mouratidis, 2016; Gyunka, and Christiana, 2017; Proctor.and Chen, 2015). It follows that relying on technological security solutions alone will never adequately protect our systems (Furnell et al, 2006, 2019; Vroom and von Solms, 2004). It is important that we understand the human factors that are associated with good security behaviours so that not only can we can better predict vulnerabilities but we can design training and education programs to address these underlying factors. A number of variables have been previously proposed as factors that may predict good cyber security behaviour in the work place such as; office environment (Pattinson et al., 2018), cyber security culture (Da Veiga and Eloff, 2010; Wiley, McCormac and Calic, 2020), resilience and work stress (McCormac et al., 2018), cognitive and cultural biases (Butavicius et al., 2017; Tsohou, Karyda and Kokolakis, 2015), learning styles (Pattinson et al., 2019), personality and risk taking propensity (McCormac et al., 2017b) and information security awareness (Parsons et al., 2017; Siponen, 2000).
In this paper, we explore a novel factor influencing cyber security behaviours, namely, people's trust in technological security solutions. These technical controls, such as firewalls and spam filters, do not provide absolute protection against all cyber threats (Furnell et al., 2019; Proofpoint, 2019; Yadron, 2014). However, if an individual incorrectly believes that this technology does provide such absolute protection, they may, as a consequence, engage in risky behaviours. Even if people know what policy states that they should do, they may still engage in non-malicious, unsafe behaviour because they believe, incorrectly, that the actions will have no consequences because of the technical security measures in place. For example, an employee may choose to click on a link in a potentially suspicious but interesting email because they believe that their actions will be safeguarded by their organisation's cyber security controls. Understanding how technical controls work, and how they can fail, is a type of knowledge. However, it is a more specific type of knowledge that is not incorporated into definitions or measures of general information security awareness in the literature (Bulgurcu, Cavusoglu, and Benbasat, 2010; Kruger and Kearney, 2006; Parsons et al., 2017; Siponen, 2000). While the information security policies tell people what to do, an understanding of the fallibility of technical safeguards relates to why people should behave in a certain way and, as such, this type of knowledge is not included in extant information security awareness measures.
Our approach to examining this concept was as follows. In the next section, we provide a review of relevant literature on trust and cyber security behaviours and formulate a set of research questions. We then present a new measure of people's faith in technological security measures, known as the Trust in Technical Controls Scale (TTCS), and then use this measure to test our research questions empirically. Specifically, we tested this measure in on online study to examine the level of trust in different safeguards (i.e., spam filters, firewalls, social media privacy settings and antivirus software), looked at how it relates to established tests of information security awareness and cognitive processing and then tested how well it can predict cyber security behaviours such as phishing email detection and password creation. Finally, we discuss the findings of this study, discuss their practical implications, indicate directions for future research and summarise the conclusions.
Section snippets
Literature review
In our review of the literature, we found no previous research that had directly measured people's trust in technical cyber controls. However, we did find evidence of the role trust plays in influencing people's behaviour when using a digital device. In short, this review suggests that while there are inconclusive results as to the role of the personality characteristic of trust in predicting cyber security behaviours, there is evidence that trust in a specific platform may predict our actions
The current study
While the literature review provides some a priori justification of the role that trust in technical controls may have in influencing poor cyber security behaviours, we found no evidence of a specific instrument to measure this trust in the literature. In this paper, we describe the development and validation of a Trust in Technical Controls Scale (TTCS) that examines the extent to which people over-trust technical cyber security safeguards including firewalls, spam filters, social media
Methodology
Participants were asked to complete an online survey, administered through Qualtrics, a Web-based survey platform. Ethics approval was granted by the Human Research Ethics Subcommittee of the School of Psychology at the University of Adelaide. The survey included demographic questions, the Trust in Technical Controls Scale (TTCS), the Human Aspects of Information Security Questionnaire (HAIS-Q), Cognitive Reflection Tests (CRT and CRT2), a measure of abstract reasoning (MRT), a phishing test
TTCS items
Initial processing of the values involved reverse scoring items 1 and 4. The raw responses to these two items were transformed so that high scores were recoded as low scores and vice versa (e.g., a score of ‘1’ was recoded as ‘5’ to indicate trust in the safeguard). After this reverse scoring, values for all four items were summed to form an overall “Trust in Technical Controls Scale” score in the range of 4 (lowest trust) to 20 (highest trust). Overall, there was a trend towards low rather
Discussion
Our results suggested that participants generally displayed a bias towards distrusting, rather than trusting, cyber security technical safeguards (RQ1). In addition, participants were almost four times less likely to trust the efficacy of social media privacy settings and spam filters than firewalls and antivirus filters (RQ2). The reasons behind these different levels of trust is worthy of further investigation. While firewalls, spam filters and antivirus-software generally do not demand much
Conclusions
This study provided evidence for the soundness and utility of the Trust in Technical Controls Scale (TTCS). The scale demonstrated good internal reliability, construct validity and criterion validity. Our findings demonstrated that participants were more likely to express a general distrust of technical controls. The items of the TTCS all appeared to relate to the same underlying concept and low scores on the scale predicted better information security awareness (ISA) and better security

" How do galaxies form? What happens when they collide? These are the kinds of questions Dr Leila Powell grappled with in her previous life as an astrophysicist.

But in 2015 she put those galactic-sized questions to one side and moved into cyber-security.

“The pursuit of understanding the universe is really important, but I got to a point where I felt like I wanted to do something that impacted people’s daily lives more,” she says.

And like many jobseekers, Ms Powell was looking for better pay and conditions.

“There are various challenges in the academic career path that can dissuade people from sticking at it, including job security and pay in comparison with industry,"" she says.

Dr Powell is lead security data scientist at Panaseer, a company that helps organisations to understand where they might have gaps in their cyber-security controls.

She’s one of many people who have brought their skills from other careers into cyber-security.

Cyber-security includes a range of roles that all aim to protect organisations and their technology from cyber-attacks. Some people help to prevent incidents by analysing or improving the security of applications, networks and devices. Others help organisations to continue operating or to recover when they are attacked.

According to ISC2, an organisation of cyber-security professionals, 39% of new employees in the sector came from a non-IT role.

“I saw an advert for a [cyber-security] job that said they needed someone with data expertise,” says Dr Powell. “The problem space appealed to me.”

“Because I was coming from a different industry, I would see things in the data that I might not have seen had I been looking for something in particular.”

When she hires new team members now, Ms Powell doesn’t mind where people acquired their skills. “I would encourage people that don’t think they have the right skills to actually have a look. If I hadn’t seen that advert, it would never have crossed my mind that cyber-security could be an industry I could get into.”

ISC2 estimates that four million more cyber-security professionals are needed worldwide.

“I would argue that it's not necessarily a skills gap because the skills are out there,” says Amanda Finch, chief executive of the Chartered Institute of Information Security (CIISec). “It's actually getting the people with the skills into cyber and then getting them to develop further.”

“I think a lot of [the shortage] is because people don’t understand what’s involved in cyber,” she adds. “A lot of security is about people, process and technology. When we do our survey of the skills we’re short of each year, technical skills come out lower than communication, analytical and problem-solving skills.”

For newcomers the pay can be good.

Cybershark Recruitment surveyed more than 2,000 UK cyber-security professionals about their salaries. Those with between one and three years’ experience earned between £40,500 and £58,000 in digital forensics; and between £39,500 and £55,000 in threat intelligence.

CIISec recommends that organisations trying to fill cyber-security roles look at the transferable skills career changers can bring.

Ms Finch advises organisations to break jobs down into duties, so it’s easier to identify the associated skills. “If you are looking at analysing logs and trends, you need somebody that's got good analytical skills,” she says. “If it's incident management, you need somebody that's able to work under pressure in a crisis with good communication skills.”

Calum Baird acquired skills like these at Police Scotland, where he worked for nearly 10 years. His roles there included response policing, violence reduction, digital forensics and cyber-crime investigation.

Now, he is a digital forensics and incident response (DFIR) consultant at Systal Technology Solutions. The company helps its clients to investigate and recover from cyber-incidents, including ransomware attacks.

“The police taught me how to quickly assess risk, and prioritise based on that risk, which is a skill that's very helpful when it comes to dealing with cyber-incident response,” he says. “It is not quite life and death [in cyber-security], but it's a significant cost to businesses and a significant disruption to people.”

His communication skills developed in the police are helpful in his current role, which includes supporting clients on what may be the worst day of their careers. “The soft skills are sometimes understated in cyber-security,” he says. “That ability to speak with the client, to put them at ease, to clearly explain the process and reassure them that they've got someone on their side fighting their corner.”

Mr Baird says he has a lifelong love of learning new skills, which was vital in the police, and remains valuable in the private sector. “There are just so many devices, so many operating systems, so many different applications out there that you won't find anyone that knows everything in depth,” he says. “A key skill in cyber-security is the ability to find a topic and dig deeper.”

Rebecca Taylor studied English and creative writing at University
According to ISC2, 41% of companies are trying to recruit non-technical people into cyber-security from other roles within the company. Rebecca Taylor is an example of someone who made that transition. She is a threat intelligence knowledge manager at Secureworks. The company provides threat detection and response technology and publishes advice on threats.

“My role is focused on grabbing anything that pertains to a threat, making sure it’s accurate and useful, and bringing it into our systems,” she says.

She joined Secureworks as a personal assistant. “It was making teas and coffees, taking minutes, sitting in conversations,” she says. “I saw very quickly that this was a field that was changing and a hundred percent fit with what I wanted, which was to keep learning.”

After working in resource coordination and change management, she became incident command knowledge manager, where she was part of the ransomware response team. “They were trying to find someone to capture notes, capture indicators, and be there to help nurture that engagement through,” she says. “I loved it.”

She works alongside people who studied history, geography and archaeology and says her own humanities background helps with her work today, processing information. “If I reflect on my English and creative writing degree, [it was about] reading significant volumes of text and being able to pull out the interesting parts.” Her writing studies help with the blogs and other materials she produces to explain cyber-security threats.

“There's a huge perception that cyber-security is going to be all technical chat, coding and AI,” she says, “but there's so much more to cyber than technical. I wouldn't describe myself as a technical individual. I'm just someone that has found a passion for distilling useful information.”",technical,cybersecurity,
" Introduction to Cybersecurity:

In our current era, the Internet has become an essential part of our daily lives, as we use it for communication, shopping, learning, entertainment, business, and many other things. However, the Internet poses a major challenge to cybersecurity, as cybercrimes and cyber breaches have become very common in recent times.

Cybersecurity is one of the most important fields in the current era, as it is based on electronic defense practices and building defensive structures that repel cyber attacks, whether on computers, websites, smartphones, servers, or uranium enrichment stations.

Today, at this time, the Internet represents 90% of our daily lives, and we are progressing more towards using the Internet for longer periods.

What is cybersecurity?
Cybersecurity is the field that relates to protecting electronic systems, networks, and electronic devices from cyber attacks, cyber breaches, and other security threats. Cybersecurity aims to protect sensitive information and important data from unauthorized access.

Common cyber threats include viruses, spyware, malicious bots, and other malicious software, as well as cyber attacks targeting a specific system or network. These attacks can steal sensitive information and data, disrupt systems, networks, and electronic devices, and cause significant damage to individuals and organizations.

Therefore, cybersecurity has become increasingly important in the age of modern technology. Cybersecurity also includes the development and implementation of security measures, policies, and technologies that help protect systems, networks, and electronic devices from cyber threats, electronic attacks, and other security threats. This includes the use of security software, the development of intrusion detection systems, and the implementation of other protective measures to reduce the risks associated with cybersecurity.

Cybersecurity is divided into two parts:

Cybersecurity Sections:
Cybersecurity can be divided into two main parts, which are defensive cybersecurity and offensive cybersecurity.

– Defensive Cyber ​​Security:
Defensive Cyber ​​Security: This is what penetrates, what does penetration testing (Penetration Testing) is a type of cyber security specialized in defense that aims to protect systems, networks and electronic devices from cyber attacks, electronic breaches and other security threats. Defensive cyber security includes the use of the necessary protection techniques, security tools and procedures necessary to achieve cyber security.

Defensive cyber security techniques include many tools and procedures, such as:

Programming and designing anti-virus and malware programs.
Programming and designing firewalls and intrusion detection systems.
Programming and designing security applications related to identity and access management.
Programming and developing encryption and digital signature techniques.
Backup and Data Recovery.
Defensive cybersecurity also requires training users on cybersecurity and ensuring that programs and systems are updated regularly, and applying appropriate security measures to achieve continuous and comprehensive security protection for electronic systems and networks.

- Offensive Cybersecurity:
Offensive Cybersecurity: This is responsible for the attack, and performing a penetration test, which is a type of cybersecurity specialized in attack that aims to direct cyber attacks and electronic breaches in a deliberate manner to access specific systems or networks and obtain sensitive information or cause damage to systems and networks. Offensive cybersecurity includes the use of interference, penetration, espionage techniques and security tools necessary to successfully carry out cyber attacks.

Techniques used in offensive cybersecurity include the following:

Using penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities in systems and networks.

Using malware, malicious software, and spyware to infiltrate systems and networks.
Using spoofing, phishing, and redirection to disguise attacks and make them appear as if they are from trusted sources.

It should be noted that offensive cybersecurity is only used with the approval of government or private sector organizations for specific purposes, such as security testing of corporate systems or cyber intelligence. This type of cybersecurity must be used with caution and responsibility to avoid potential negative repercussions.

In the end, each has its own specialty, as defensive cybersecurity skills may not have offensive cybersecurity skills.

Even jobs in this field vary, as some people require a defensive cybersecurity specialist, and others require an offensive cybersecurity specialist.",technical,cybersecurity,
" What is cybersecurity?
Cybersecurity refers to any technologies, practices and policies for preventing cyberattacks or mitigating their impact. Cybersecurity aims to protect computer systems, applications, devices, data, financial assets and people against ransomware and other malware, phishing scams, data theft and other cyberthreats.

At the enterprise level, cybersecurity is a key component of an organization’s overall risk management strategy. According to Cybersecurity Ventures, global spending on cybersecurity products and services will exceed USD 1.75 trillion total during the years 2021 through 2025.1

Cybersecurity job growth is also robust. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that “employment of information security analysts is projected to grow 32% from 2022 to 2032, faster than the average for all occupations.”2

Why cybersecurity is important
Cybersecurity is important because cyberattacks and cybercrime have the power to disrupt, damage or destroy businesses, communities and lives. Successful cyberattacks lead to identity theft, personal and corporate extortion, loss of sensitive information and business-critical data, temporary business outages, lost business and lost customers and, in some cases, business closures.

Cyberattacks have an enormous and growing impact on businesses and the economy. By one estimate, cybercrime will cost the world economy USD 10.5 trillion per year by 2025.3 The cost of cyberattacks continues to rise as cybercriminals become more sophisticated.

According to IBM's latest Cost of a Data Breach Report:

The average cost of a data breach jumped to USD 4.88 million from USD 4.45 million in 2023—a 10% spike and the highest increase since the pandemic.
Business losses (revenue loss due to system downtime, lost customers and reputational damage) and post-breach response costs (costs to set up call centers and credit monitoring services for affected customers or to pay regulatory fines), rose nearly 11% over the previous year.

The number of organizations paying more than USD 50,000 in regulatory fines as a result of a data breach rose 22.7% over the previous year; those paying more than USD 100,000 rose 19.5%.

Cybersecurity challenges
Apart from the sheer volume of cyberattacks, one of the biggest challenges for cybersecurity professionals is the ever-evolving nature of the information technology (IT) landscape, and the way threats evolve with it. Many emerging technologies that offer tremendous new advantages for businesses and individuals also present new opportunities for threat actors and cybercriminals to launch increasingly sophisticated attacks. For example:

The pervasive adoption of cloud computing can increase network management complexity and raise the risk of cloud misconfigurations, improperly secured APIs and other avenues hackers can exploit.
More remote work, hybrid work and bring-your-own-device (BYOD) policies mean more connections, devices, applications and data for security teams to protect.
Proliferating Internet of Things (IoT) and connected devices, many of which are unsecured or improperly secured by default, can be easily hijacked by bad actors.

The rise of artificial intelligence (AI), and of generative AI in particular, presents an entirely new threat landscape that hackers are already exploiting through prompt injection and other techniques. According to recent research from the IBM® Institute for Business Value, only 24% of generative AI initiatives are secured.
As the worldwide attack surface expands, the cybersecurity workforce is struggling to keep pace. A World Economic Forum study found that the global cybersecurity worker gap—the gap between cybersecurity workers and jobs that need to be filled—might reach 85 million workers by 2030.4

Closing this skills gap can have an impact. According to the Cost of a Data Breach 2024 Report, organizations suffering from a high-level shortage of security skills saw an average cost per breach of USD 5.74 million, compared to USD 3.98 million for organizations with lower-level skills shortages.

Resource-strained security teams will increasingly turn to security technologies featuring advanced analytics, artificial intelligence (AI) and automation to strengthen their cyber defenses and minimize the impact of successful attacks.

Types of cybersecurity
Comprehensive cybersecurity strategies protect all of an organization’s IT infrastructure layers against cyberthreats and cybercrime. Some of the most important cybersecurity domains include:

AI security
Critical infrastructure security
Network security
Endpoint security
Application security
Cloud security
Information security
Mobile security
AI security
AI security refers to measures and technology aimed at preventing or mitigating cyberthreats and cyberattacks that target AI applications or systems or that use AI in malicious ways.

Generative AI offers threat actors new attack vectors to exploit. Hackers can use malicious prompts to manipulate AI apps, poison data sources to distort AI outputs and even trick AI tools into sharing sensitive information. They can also use (and have already used) generative AI to create malicious code and phishing emails.

AI security uses specialized risk management frameworks—and increasingly, AI-enabled cybersecurity tools—to protect the AI attack surface. According to the Cost of a Data Breach 2024 Report, organizations that deployed AI-enabled security tools and automation extensively for cyberthreat prevention saw a USD 2.2 million lower average cost per breach compared to organizations with no AI deployed.

Critical infrastructure security
Critical infrastructure security protects the computer systems, applications, networks, data and digital assets that a society depends on for national security, economic health and public safety.

In the United States, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) offers a cybersecurity framework to help IT providers and stakeholders secure critical infrastructure.5 The US Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) also provides guidance.6

Network security
Network security focuses on preventing unauthorized access to networks and network resources. It also helps ensure that authorized users have secure and reliable access to the resources and assets they need to do their jobs.

Application security
Application security helps prevent unauthorized access to and use of apps and related data. It also helps identify and mitigate flaws or vulnerabilities in application design. Modern application development methods such as DevOps and DevSecOps build security and security testing into the development process.

Cloud security
Cloud security secures an organization’s cloud-based services and assets, including applications, data, virtual servers and other infrastructure.

Generally speaking, cloud security operates on the shared responsibility model. The cloud provider is responsible for securing the services that they deliver and the infrastructure that delivers them. The customer is responsible for protecting their data, code and other assets they store or run in the cloud.

Information security and data security
Information security (InfoSec) protects an organization's important information—digital files and data, paper documents, physical media—against unauthorized access, use or alteration.

Data security, the protection of digital information, is a subset of information security and the focus of most cybersecurity-related InfoSec measures.

Mobile security
Mobile security encompasses cybersecurity tools and practices specific to smartphones and other mobile devices, including mobile application management (MAM) and enterprise mobility management (EMM).

More recently, organizations are adopting unified endpoint management (UEM) solutions that allow them to protect, configure and manage all endpoint devices, including mobile devices, from a single console.

Common cybersecurity threats
Some of the most common types of cyberthreats include

Malware
Ransomware
Phishing
Credential theft and abuse
Insider threats
AI attacks
Cryptojacking
Distributed denial of service (DDoS)
Malware
Malware, short for ""malicious software"", is any software code or computer program that is intentionally written to harm a computer system or its users. Almost every modern cyberattack involves some type of malware.

Hackers and cybercriminals create and use malware to gain unauthorized access to computer systems and sensitive data, hijack computer systems and operate them remotely, disrupt or damage computer systems, or hold data or systems hostage for large sums of money (see ""Ransomware"").

Ransomware
Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts a victim’s data or device and threatens to keep it encrypted—or worse—unless the victim pays a ransom to the attacker.

The earliest ransomware attacks demanded a ransom in exchange for the encryption key required to unlock the victim’s data. Starting around 2019, almost all ransomware attacks were double extortion attacks that also threatened to publicly share victims’ data; some triple extortion attacks added the threat of a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack.

More recently, ransomware attacks are on the decline. According to the IBM X-Force Threat Intelligence Index 2024, ransomware attacks accounted for 20% of all attacks in 2023, down 11.5% from 2022. The decline is likely the result of improved ransomware prevention, more effective law enforcement intervention and data backup and protection practices that enable businesses to recover without paying the ransom.

In the meantime, ransomware attackers have repurposed their resources to start other types of cyberthreats, including infostealer malware that allows attackers to steal data and hold it hostage without locking down the victim’s systems and data destruction attacks that destroy or threaten to destroy data for specific purposes.

Phishing
Phishing attacks are email, text or voice messages that trick users into downloading malware, sharing sensitive information or sending funds to the wrong people.

Most users are familiar with bulk phishing scams—mass-mailed fraudulent messages that appear to be from a large and trusted brand, asking recipients to reset their passwords or reenter credit card information. More sophisticated phishing scams, such as spear phishing and business email compromise (BEC), target specific individuals or groups to steal especially valuable data or large sums of money.

Phishing is just one type of social engineering, a class of “human hacking” tactics and interactive attacks that use psychological manipulation to pressure people into taking unwise actions.

Credential theft and account abuse
The X-Force Threat Intelligence Index found that identity-based attacks, which hijack legitimate user accounts and abuse their privileges, account for 30% of attacks. This makes identity-based attacks the most common entry point into corporate networks.

Hackers have many techniques for stealing credentials and taking over accounts. For example, Kerberoasting attacks manipulate the Kerberos authentication protocol commonly used in Microsoft Active Directory to seize privileged service accounts. In 2023, the IBM X-Force team experienced a 100% increase in Kerberoasting incidents.

Similarly, the X-Force team saw a 266% increase in the use of infostealer malware that secretly records user credentials and other sensitive data.

Insider threats
Insider threats are threats that originate with authorized users—employees, contractors, business partners—who intentionally or accidentally misuse their legitimate access or have their accounts hijacked by cybercriminals.

Insider threats can be harder to detect than external threats because they have the earmarks of authorized activity and are invisible to antivirus software, firewalls and other security solutions that block external attacks.

AI attacks
Much like cybersecurity professionals are using AI to strengthen their defenses, cybercriminals are using AI to conduct advanced attacks.

In generative AI fraud, scammers use generative AI to produce fake emails, applications and other business documents to fool people into sharing sensitive data or sending money.

The X-Force Threat Intelligence Index reports that scammers can use open source generative AI tools to craft convincing phishing emails in as little as five minutes. For comparison, it takes scammers 16 hours to come up with the same message manually.

Hackers are also using organizations’ AI tools as attack vectors. For example, in prompt injection attacks, threat actors use malicious inputs to manipulate generative AI systems into leaking sensitive data, spreading misinformation or worse.

Cryptojacking
Cryptojacking happens when hackers gain access to an endpoint device and secretly use its computing resources to mine cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, ether or monero.

Security analysts identified cryptojacking as a cyberthreat around 2011, shortly after the introduction of cryptocurrency. According to the IBM X-Force Threat Intelligence Index, cryptojacking is now among the top three areas of operations for cybercriminals.

Distributed denial of service (DDoS)
A DDoS attack attempts to crash a server, website or network by overloading it with traffic, usually from a botnet—a network of distributed systems that a cybercriminal hijacks by using malware and remote-controlled operations.

The global volume of DDoS attacks spiked during the COVID-19 pandemic. Increasingly, attackers are combining DDoS attacks with ransomware attacks, or simply threatening to launch DDoS attacks unless the target pays a ransom.

Cybersecurity myths
Despite an ever-increasing volume of cybersecurity incidents worldwide and the insights gleaned from resolving these incidents, some misconceptions persist. Some of the most dangerous include:

Strong passwords are adequate protection
Strong passwords do make a difference; for example, a 12-character password takes 62 trillion times longer to crack than a 6-character password. But passwords are relatively easy to acquire in other ways, such as through social engineering, keylogging malware, buying them on the dark web or paying disgruntled insiders to steal them.

Most cybersecurity risks are well-known
In fact, the cyberthreat landscape is constantly changing. Thousands of new vulnerabilities are reported in old and new applications and devices every year. Opportunities for human error—specifically by negligent employees or contractors who unintentionally cause a data breach—keep increasing.

All cyberattack vectors are contained
Cybercriminals find new attack vectors all the time. The rise of AI technologies, operational technology (OT), Internet of Things (IoT) devices and cloud environments all give hackers new opportunities to cause trouble.

My industry is safe
Every industry has its share of cybersecurity risks. For example, ransomware attacks are targeting more sectors than ever, including local governments, nonprofits and healthcare providers. Attacks on supply chains, "".gov"" websites and critical infrastructure have also increased.

Cybercriminals don’t attack small businesses
Yes, they do. The Hiscox Cyber Readiness Report found that almost half (41%) of small businesses in the US experienced a cyberattack in the last year.7

Key cybersecurity best practices and technologies
While each organization’s cybersecurity strategy differs, many use these tools and tactics to reduce vulnerabilities, prevent attacks and intercept attacks in progress:

Security awareness training
Data security tools
Identity and access management
Threat detection and response
Disaster recovery
Security awareness training
Security awareness training helps users understand how seemingly harmless actions—from using the same simple password for multiple log-ins to oversharing on social media—increase their own or their organization’s risk of attack.

Combined with thought-out data security policies, security awareness training can help employees protect sensitive personal and organizational data. It can also help them recognize and avoid phishing and malware attacks.

Data security tools
Data security tools, such as encryption and data loss prevention (DLP) solutions, can help stop security threats in progress or mitigate their effects. For example, DLP tools can detect and block attempted data theft, while encryption can make it so that any data that hackers steal is useless to them.

Identity and access management
Identity and access management (IAM) refers to the tools and strategies that control how users access resources and what they can do with those resources.

IAM technologies can help protect against account theft. For example, multifactor authentication requires users to supply multiple credentials to log in, meaning threat actors need more than just a password to break into an account.

Likewise, adaptive authentication systems detect when users are engaging in risky behavior and raise additional authentication challenges before allowing them to proceed. Adaptive authentication can help limit the lateral movement of hackers who make it into the system.

A zero trust architecture is one way to enforce strict access controls by verifying all connection requests between users and devices, applications and data.

Attack surface management
Attack surface management (ASM) is the continuous discovery, analysis, remediation and monitoring of the cybersecurity vulnerabilities and potential attack vectors that make up an organization’s attack surface.

Unlike other cyberdefense disciplines, ASM is conducted entirely from a hacker’s perspective rather than the perspective of the defender. It identifies targets and assesses risks based on the opportunities they present to a malicious attacker.

Threat detection and response
Analytics- and AI-driven technologies can help identify and respond to attacks in progress. These technologies can include security information and event management (SIEM), security orchestration, automation and response (SOAR) and endpoint detection and response (EDR). Typically, organizations use these technologies as part of a formal incident response plan.",technical,cybersecurity,
" Our world today consists of a set of different devices and means that surround us in everything we deal with, all of which share one factor, which is their dependence on the software instructions that run them, and if any error occurs in these instructions, personal and sensitive data records in these technologies may become vulnerable to malicious use. This is where the importance of writing secure code comes in, which are guidelines for developers and programmers that govern and impose the methodology followed when implementing software features, and range from simple suggestions such as ensuring that steps are documented when expanding the code base, to detailed instructions for the structure and design of the code.

How do we know that the services we use are secure?

Programming work provided by public sector institutions is governed by government authorities, while private and limited companies must provide proof that their basic infrastructure is subject to some form of deep insurance assurance, and if they do not comply, they may face the risk of fines and penalties, and insurance companies may even cancel their contracts; therefore, technology companies put the principle of securing code at the top of their priorities to protect their financial interests and reputation.

What happens if a mistake occurs in the code?

Some of the most damaging security vulnerabilities are due to flaws in the code’s secure writing practices themselves, but if we do these practices properly, we can reduce the rate of security issues, so we need to implement strict security quality checks to ensure that our code is free of problems after it is written. One example of such a vulnerability is the vulnerability that the EternalBlue malware exploited in Windows operating systems and its core components to cause software problems and leak the WannaCry ransomware attack to more than 230,000 computers worldwide in just one day!

Secure writing practices are evolving day by day, which reduces the number of exploitable vulnerabilities in modern software code, but on the other hand, the number of digitally connected devices that we use every day is increasing dramatically, which increases the risk of exposure to problems and the need for security protection.",technical,cybersecurity,
" Abstract
Cybercrime is estimated to have cost the global economy just under USD 1 trillion in 2020, indicating an increase of more than 50% since 2018. With the average cyber insurance claim rising from USD 145,000 in 2019 to USD 359,000 in 2020, there is a growing necessity for better cyber information sources, standardised databases, mandatory reporting and public awareness. This research analyses the extant academic and industry literature on cybersecurity and cyber risk management with a particular focus on data availability. From a preliminary search resulting in 5219 cyber peer-reviewed studies, the application of the systematic methodology resulted in 79 unique datasets. We posit that the lack of available data on cyber risk poses a serious problem for stakeholders seeking to tackle this issue. In particular, we identify a lacuna in open databases that undermine collective endeavours to better manage this set of risks. The resulting data evaluation and categorisation will support cybersecurity researchers and the insurance industry in their efforts to comprehend, metricise and manage cyber risks.

Introduction
Globalisation, digitalisation and smart technologies have escalated the propensity and severity of cybercrime. Whilst it is an emerging field of research and industry, the importance of robust cybersecurity defence systems has been highlighted at the corporate, national and supranational levels. The impacts of inadequate cybersecurity are estimated to have cost the global economy USD 945 billion in 2020 (Maleks Smith et al. 2020). Cyber vulnerabilities pose significant corporate risks, including business interruption, breach of privacy and financial losses (Sheehan et al. 2019). Despite the increasing relevance for the international economy, the availability of data on cyber risks remains limited. The reasons for this are many. Firstly, it is an emerging and evolving risk; therefore, historical data sources are limited (Biener et al. 2015). It could also be due to the fact that, in general, institutions that have been hacked do not publish the incidents (Eling and Schnell 2016). The lack of data poses challenges for many areas, such as research, risk management and cybersecurity (Falco et al. 2019). The importance of this topic is demonstrated by the announcement of the European Council in April 2021 that a centre of excellence for cybersecurity will be established to pool investments in research, technology and industrial development. The goal of this centre is to increase the security of the internet and other critical network and information systems (European Council 2021).

This research takes a risk management perspective, focusing on cyber risk and considering the role of cybersecurity and cyber insurance in risk mitigation and risk transfer. The study reviews the existing literature and open data sources related to cybersecurity and cyber risk. This is the first systematic review of data availability in the general context of cyber risk and cybersecurity. By identifying and critically analysing the available datasets, this paper supports the research community by aggregating, summarising and categorising all available open datasets. In addition, further information on datasets is attached to provide deeper insights and support stakeholders engaged in cyber risk control and cybersecurity. Finally, this research paper highlights the need for open access to cyber-specific data, without price or permission barriers.

The identified open data can support cyber insurers in their efforts on sustainable product development. To date, traditional risk assessment methods have been untenable for insurance companies due to the absence of historical claims data (Sheehan et al. 2021). These high levels of uncertainty mean that cyber insurers are more inclined to overprice cyber risk cover (Kshetri 2018). Combining external data with insurance portfolio data therefore seems to be essential to improve the evaluation of the risk and thus lead to risk-adjusted pricing (Bessy-Roland et al. 2021). This argument is also supported by the fact that some re/insurers reported that they are working to improve their cyber pricing models (e.g. by creating or purchasing databases from external providers) (EIOPA 2018). Figure 1 provides an overview of pricing tools and factors considered in the estimation of cyber insurance based on the findings of EIOPA (2018) and the research of Romanosky et al. (2019). The term cyber risk refers to all cyber risks and their potential impact.",technical,cybersecurity,
" esides the advantage of risk-adjusted pricing, the availability of open datasets helps companies benchmark their internal cyber posture and cybersecurity measures. The research can also help to improve risk awareness and corporate behaviour. Many companies still underestimate their cyber risk (Leong and Chen 2020). For policymakers, this research offers starting points for a comprehensive recording of cyber risks. Although in many countries, companies are obliged to report data breaches to the respective supervisory authority, this information is usually not accessible to the research community. Furthermore, the economic impact of these breaches is usually unclear.

As well as the cyber risk management community, this research also supports cybersecurity stakeholders. Researchers are provided with an up-to-date, peer-reviewed literature of available datasets showing where these datasets have been used. For example, this includes datasets that have been used to evaluate the effectiveness of countermeasures in simulated cyberattacks or to test intrusion detection systems. This reduces a time-consuming search for suitable datasets and ensures a comprehensive review of those available. Through the dataset descriptions, researchers and industry stakeholders can compare and select the most suitable datasets for their purposes. In addition, it is possible to combine the datasets from one source in the context of cybersecurity or cyber risk. This supports efficient and timely progress in cyber risk research and is beneficial given the dynamic nature of cyber risks.

Cyber risks are defined as “operational risks to information and technology assets that have consequences affecting the confidentiality, availability, and/or integrity of information or information systems” (Cebula et al. 2014). Prominent cyber risk events include data breaches and cyberattacks (Agrafiotis et al. 2018). The increasing exposure and potential impact of cyber risk have been highlighted in recent industry reports (e.g. Allianz 2021; World Economic Forum 2020). Cyberattacks on critical infrastructures are ranked 5th in the World Economic Forum's Global Risk Report. Ransomware, malware and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) are examples of the evolving modes of a cyberattack. One example is the ransomware attack on the Colonial Pipeline, which shut down the 5500 mile pipeline system that delivers 2.5 million barrels of fuel per day and critical liquid fuel infrastructure from oil refineries to states along the U.S. East Coast (Brower and McCormick 2021). These and other cyber incidents have led the U.S. to strengthen its cybersecurity and introduce, among other things, a public body to analyse major cyber incidents and make recommendations to prevent a recurrence (Murphey 2021a). Another example of the scope of cyberattacks is the ransomware NotPetya in 2017. The damage amounted to USD 10 billion, as the ransomware exploited a vulnerability in the windows system, allowing it to spread independently worldwide in the network (GAO 2021). In the same year, the ransomware WannaCry was launched by cybercriminals. The cyberattack on Windows software took user data hostage in exchange for Bitcoin cryptocurrency (Smart 2018). The victims included the National Health Service in Great Britain. As a result, ambulances were redirected to other hospitals because of information technology (IT) systems failing, leaving people in need of urgent assistance waiting. It has been estimated that 19,000 cancelled treatment appointments resulted from losses of GBP 92 million (Field 2018). Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, ransomware attacks increased significantly, as working from home arrangements increased vulnerability (Murphey 2021b).

Besides cyberattacks, data breaches can also cause high costs. Under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), companies are obliged to protect personal data and safeguard the data protection rights of all individuals in the EU area. The GDPR allows data protection authorities in each country to impose sanctions and fines on organisations they find in breach. “For data breaches, the maximum fine can be €20 million or 4% of global turnover, whichever is higher” (GDPR.EU 2021). Data breaches often involve a large amount of sensitive data that has been accessed, unauthorised, by external parties, and are therefore considered important for information security due to their far-reaching impact (Goode et al. 2017). A data breach is defined as a “security incident in which sensitive, protected, or confidential data are copied, transmitted, viewed, stolen, or used by an unauthorized individual” (Freeha et al. 2021). Depending on the amount of data, the extent of the damage caused by a data breach can be significant, with the average cost being USD 392 million1 (IBM Security 2020).

This research paper reviews the existing literature and open data sources related to cybersecurity and cyber risk, focusing on the datasets used to improve academic understanding and advance the current state-of-the-art in cybersecurity. Furthermore, important information about the available datasets is presented (e.g. use cases), and a plea is made for open data and the standardisation of cyber risk data for academic comparability and replication. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. The next section describes the related work regarding cybersecurity and cyber risks. The third section outlines the review method used in this work and the process. The fourth section details the results of the identified literature. Further discussion is presented in the penultimate section and the final section concludes.

Related work
Due to the significance of cyber risks, several literature reviews have been conducted in this field. Eling (2020) reviewed the existing academic literature on the topic of cyber risk and cyber insurance from an economic perspective. A total of 217 papers with the term ‘cyber risk’ were identified and classified in different categories. As a result, open research questions are identified, showing that research on cyber risks is still in its infancy because of their dynamic and emerging nature. Furthermore, the author highlights that particular focus should be placed on the exchange of information between public and private actors. An improved information flow could help to measure the risk more accurately and thus make cyber risks more insurable and help risk managers to determine the right level of cyber risk for their company. In the context of cyber insurance data, Romanosky et al. (2019) analysed the underwriting process for cyber insurance and revealed how cyber insurers understand and assess cyber risks. For this research, they examined 235 American cyber insurance policies that were publicly available and looked at three components (coverage, application questionnaires and pricing). The authors state in their findings that many of the insurers used very simple, flat-rate pricing (based on a single calculation of expected loss), while others used more parameters such as the asset value of the company (or company revenue) or standard insurance metrics (e.g. deductible, limits), and the industry in the calculation. This is in keeping with Eling (2020), who states that an increased amount of data could help to make cyber risk more accurately measured and thus more insurable. Similar research on cyber insurance and data was conducted by Nurse et al. (2020). The authors examined cyber insurance practitioners' perceptions and the challenges they face in collecting and using data. In addition, gaps were identified during the research where further data is needed. The authors concluded that cyber insurance is still in its infancy, and there are still several unanswered questions (for example, cyber valuation, risk calculation and recovery). They also pointed out that a better understanding of data collection and use in cyber insurance would be invaluable for future research and practice. Bessy-Roland et al. (2021) come to a similar conclusion. They proposed a multivariate Hawkes framework to model and predict the frequency of cyberattacks. They used a public dataset with characteristics of data breaches affecting the U.S. industry. In the conclusion, the authors make the argument that an insurer has a better knowledge of cyber losses, but that it is based on a small dataset and therefore combination with external data sources seems essential to improve the assessment of cyber risks.

Several systematic reviews have been published in the area of cybersecurity (Kruse et al. 2017; Lee et al. 2020; Loukas et al. 2013; Ulven and Wangen 2021). In these papers, the authors concentrated on a specific area or sector in the context of cybersecurity. This paper adds to this extant literature by focusing on data availability and its importance to risk management and insurance stakeholders. With a priority on healthcare and cybersecurity, Kruse et al. (2017) conducted a systematic literature review. The authors identified 472 articles with the keywords ‘cybersecurity and healthcare’ or ‘ransomware’ in the databases Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature, PubMed and Proquest. Articles were eligible for this review if they satisfied three criteria: (1) they were published between 2006 and 2016, (2) the full-text version of the article was available, and (3) the publication is a peer-reviewed or scholarly journal. The authors found that technological development and federal policies (in the U.S.) are the main factors exposing the health sector to cyber risks. Loukas et al. (2013) conducted a review with a focus on cyber risks and cybersecurity in emergency management. The authors provided an overview of cyber risks in communication, sensor, information management and vehicle technologies used in emergency management and showed areas for which there is still no solution in the literature. Similarly, Ulven and Wangen (2021) reviewed the literature on cybersecurity risks in higher education institutions. For the literature review, the authors used the keywords ‘cyber’, ‘information threats’ or ‘vulnerability’ in connection with the terms ‘higher education, ‘university’ or ‘academia’. A similar literature review with a focus on Internet of Things (IoT) cybersecurity was conducted by Lee et al. (2020). The review revealed that qualitative approaches focus on high-level frameworks, and quantitative approaches to cybersecurity risk management focus on risk assessment and quantification of cyberattacks and impacts. In addition, the findings presented a four-step IoT cyber risk management framework that identifies, quantifies and prioritises cyber risks.

Datasets are an essential part of cybersecurity research, underlined by the following works. Ilhan Firat et al. (2021) examined various cybersecurity datasets in detail. The study was motivated by the fact that with the proliferation of the internet and smart technologies, the mode of cyberattacks is also evolving. However, in order to prevent such attacks, they must first be detected; the dissemination and further development of cybersecurity datasets is therefore critical. In their work, the authors observed studies of datasets used in intrusion detection systems. Khraisat et al. (2019) also identified a need for new datasets in the context of cybersecurity. The researchers presented a taxonomy of current intrusion detection systems, a comprehensive review of notable recent work, and an overview of the datasets commonly used for assessment purposes. In their conclusion, the authors noted that new datasets are needed because most machine-learning techniques are trained and evaluated on the knowledge of old datasets. These datasets do not contain new and comprehensive information and are partly derived from datasets from 1999. The authors noted that the core of this issue is the availability of new public datasets as well as their quality. The availability of data, how it is used, created and shared was also investigated by Zheng et al. (2018). The researchers analysed 965 cybersecurity research papers published between 2012 and 2016. They created a taxonomy of the types of data that are created and shared and then analysed the data collected via datasets. The researchers concluded that while datasets are recognised as valuable for cybersecurity research, the proportion of publicly available datasets is limited.

The main contributions of this review and what differentiates it from previous studies can be summarised as follows. First, as far as we can tell, it is the first work to summarise all available datasets on cyber risk and cybersecurity in the context of a systematic review and present them to the scientific community and cyber insurance and cybersecurity stakeholders. Second, we investigated, analysed, and made available the datasets to support efficient and timely progress in cyber risk research. And third, we enable comparability of datasets so that the appropriate dataset can be selected depending on the research area.",technical,cybersecurity,
" Methodology
Process and eligibility criteria
The structure of this systematic review is inspired by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) framework (Page et al. 2021), and the search was conducted from 3 to 10 May 2021. Due to the continuous development of cyber risks and their countermeasures, only articles published in the last 10 years were considered. In addition, only articles published in peer-reviewed journals written in English were included. As a final criterion, only articles that make use of one or more cybersecurity or cyber risk datasets met the inclusion criteria. Specifically, these studies presented new or existing datasets, used them for methods, or used them to verify new results, as well as analysed them in an economic context and pointed out their effects. The criterion was fulfilled if it was clearly stated in the abstract that one or more datasets were used. A detailed explanation of this selection criterion can be found in the ‘Study selection’ section.

Information sources
In order to cover a complete spectrum of literature, various databases were queried to collect relevant literature on the topic of cybersecurity and cyber risks. Due to the spread of related articles across multiple databases, the literature search was limited to the following four databases for simplicity: IEEE Xplore, Scopus, SpringerLink and Web of Science. This is similar to other literature reviews addressing cyber risks or cybersecurity, including Sardi et al. (2021), Franke and Brynielsson (2014), Lagerström (2019), Eling and Schnell (2016) and Eling (2020). In this paper, all databases used in the aforementioned works were considered. However, only two studies also used all the databases listed. The IEEE Xplore database contains electrical engineering, computer science, and electronics work from over 200 journals and three million conference papers (IEEE 2021). Scopus includes 23,400 peer-reviewed journals from more than 5000 international publishers in the areas of science, engineering, medicine, social sciences and humanities (Scopus 2021). SpringerLink contains 3742 journals and indexes over 10 million scientific documents (SpringerLink 2021). Finally, Web of Science indexes over 9200 journals in different scientific disciplines (Science 2021).

Search
A search string was created and applied to all databases. To make the search efficient and reproducible, the following search string with Boolean operator was used in all databases: cybersecurity OR cyber risk AND dataset OR database. To ensure uniformity of the search across all databases, some adjustments had to be made for the respective search engines. In Scopus, for example, the Advanced Search was used, and the field code ‘Title-ABS-KEY’ was integrated into the search string. For IEEE Xplore, the search was carried out with the Search String in the Command Search and ‘All Metadata’. In the Web of Science database, the Advanced Search was used. The special feature of this search was that it had to be carried out in individual steps. The first search was carried out with the terms cybersecurity OR cyber risk with the field tag Topic (T.S. =) and the second search with dataset OR database. Subsequently, these searches were combined, which then delivered the searched articles for review. For SpringerLink, the search string was used in the Advanced Search under the category ‘Find the resources with all of the words’. After conducting this search string, 5219 studies could be found. According to the eligibility criteria (period, language and only scientific journals), 1581 studies were identified in the databases:",technical,cybersecurity,
" Study selection
In the final step of the selection process, the articles were screened for relevance. Due to a large number of results, the abstracts were analysed in the first step of the process. The aim was to determine whether the article was relevant for the systematic review. An article fulfilled the criterion if it was recognisable in the abstract that it had made a contribution to datasets or databases with regard to cyber risks or cybersecurity. Specifically, the criterion was considered to be met if the abstract used datasets that address the causes or impacts of cyber risks, and measures in the area of cybersecurity. In this process, the number of articles was reduced to 288. The articles were then read in their entirety, and an expert panel of six people decided whether they should be used. This led to a final number of 255 articles. The years in which the articles were published and the exact number can be seen in Fig. 3.

Distribution of studies

Data collection process and synthesis of the results
For the data collection process, various data were extracted from the studies, including the names of the respective creators, the name of the dataset or database and the corresponding reference. It was also determined where the data came from. In the context of accessibility, it was determined whether access is free, controlled, available for purchase or not available. It was also determined when the datasets were created and the time period referenced. The application type and domain characteristics of the datasets were identified.

Results
This section analyses the results of the systematic literature review. The previously identified studies are divided into three categories: datasets on the causes of cyber risks, datasets on the effects of cyber risks and datasets on cybersecurity. The classification is based on the intended use of the studies. This system of classification makes it easier for stakeholders to find the appropriate datasets. The categories are evaluated individually. Although complete information is available for a large proportion of datasets, this is not true for all of them. Accordingly, the abbreviation N/A has been inserted in the respective characters to indicate that this information could not be determined by the time of submission. The term ‘use cases in the literature’ in the following and supplementary tables refers to the application areas in which the corresponding datasets were used in the literature. The areas listed there refer to the topic area on which the researchers conducted their research. Since some datasets were used interdisciplinarily, the listed use cases in the literature are correspondingly longer. Before discussing each category in the next sections, Fig. 4 provides an overview of the number of datasets found and their year of creation. Figure 5 then shows the relationship between studies and datasets in the period under consideration. Figure 6 shows the distribution of studies, their use of datasets and their creation date. The number of datasets used is higher than the number of studies because the studies often used several datasets ",technical,cybersecurity,

" Types of Cybersecurity
Cybersecurity can mean different things depending on which aspect of technology you’re managing. Here are the categories of cybersecurity that IT pros need to know.

Critical Infrastructure Security
Critical infrastructure security includes the things you do to protect the computer systems your organization needs to stay operational. Seems like a no-brainer, right? This includes any technology, processes, safeguards and other protections you use to keep those critical systems safe and running.

Network Security
Network security involves all of the activities it takes to protect your network infrastructure. This might involve configuring firewalls, securing VPNs, managing access control or implementing antivirus software. Cybersecurity pros in this field will protect against network threats and data breaches that occur on the network.

Endpoint Security
Endpoints are any devices connected to your network. This could include desktops, laptops, tablets, mobile devices or smart TVs. Protecting endpoints requires activities such as threat and anomalous activity detection, multi-factor authentication, user training and policy development surrounding endpoint usage. This may also include safeguarding physical locations containing endpoint devices.

Application Security
Application security involves the configuration of security settings within individual apps to protect them against cyberattacks. This might involve resolving bugs in code and implementing cybersecurity measures to protect against bad actors. Securing applications helps to strengthen data security in the cloud-native era.

Information Security
Information security includes any data-protection safeguards you put into place. This broad term involves any activities you undertake to ensure personally identifiable information (PII) and other sensitive data remains under lock and key.

Cloud Security
Cloud security specifically involves activities needed to prevent attacks on cloud applications and infrastructure. These activities help to ensure all data remains private and secure as its passed between different internet-based applications.

Mobile Security
Who over the age (or under) of 18 doesn’t have a mobile device? We all do. Our mobile devices go everywhere with us and are a staple in our daily lives. Mobile security ensures all devices are protected against vulnerabilities. Since we all store sensitive information and use our devices for everything from shopping to sending work emails, mobile security helps to keep device data secure and away from cybercriminals. There’s no telling how threat actors might use identity theft as another weapon in their arsenal!

Internet of Things (IoT) Security
Internet of things security includes all the ways you protect information being passed between connected devices. As more and more IoT devices are being used in the cloud-native era, more stringent security protocols are necessary to ensure data isn’t compromised as its being shared between IoT. IoT security keeps the IoT ecosystem safeguarded at all times.

Zero Trust
Zero trust is a cybersecurity strategy where every user is verified and every connection is authorized. No one is given access to resources by default. Under this model, cybersecurity pros require verification from every source regardless of their position inside or outside the network perimeter. This requires implementing strict access controls and policies to help limit vulnerabilities.

People
Your people are an indispensable asset while simultaneously being a weak link in the cybersecurity chain. In fact, human error is responsible for 95% breaches. Organizations spend so much time making sure that technology is secure when there remains a sore lack of preparing employees for cyber incidents and the threats of social engineering (see more below). Most often, end users aren’t threat actors—they just lack the necessary training and education to understand the implications of their actions.

Here are six ways that humans contribute to your cybersecurity risk:

Fraudulent emails and malicious URLs. Threat actors are talented and one of the avenues where they see a lot of success tricking employees involves malicious URL links and illegitimate emails. Training can go a long way toward helping your people identify fraudulent emails and links. Teach them to identify red flags such as emails with no content, emails originating from unidentifiable senders, spoofed addresses and messages soliciting personal or sensitive information. Also, encourage immediate reporting of any discovered attempts to limit the risk to others.

Insecure and infrequently updated passwords. We all have our go-to passwords. Maybe it includes your children’s name, your dog’s birthday or an anniversary. Either way, it’s time to ditch overused passwords. Not only should you be regularly updating passwords, but you need to educate users to choose strong passwords. And rather than sticking them on a sticky note in plain sight, consider using a secure password management tool.

Misdelivery of sensitive information. If you’ve ever received an email by mistake, you certainly aren’t alone. Email providers make suggestions about who they think should be included on an email and humans sometimes unwittingly send sensitive information to the wrong recipients. Making sure that all messages contain the right people can limit this error.

Unintentionally sharing PII. In the era of remote work, it can be difficult to keep the lines from blurring between our professional and personal lives. Instruct your employees not to shop on work devices and limit oversharing on social media. There’s no telling how that information could be used to compromise company data.

Failing to update devices. If seeing unattended notifications on your device makes you feel very real anxiety, you probably aren’t one of these people. But some of us are really good at ignoring those pesky alerts to update our devices. This can lead to easily avoided vulnerabilities, which you can prevent by simply doing the necessary updates. In fact, the infamous WannaCry ransomware attack targeted a vulnerability in systems that Microsoft had already applied a fix for, but it was able to successfully infiltrate devices that hadn’t yet been updated.

Lack of physical security. Yes, even if your iPhone locks after two minutes of idleness, that doesn’t mean it’s safe from prying eyes when left in the airport bathroom. Or maybe you typed in a code and a threat actor was peeking over your shoulder. In any case, it’s important that you take physical security seriously and keep tabs on your devices at all times.

Processes
Any cybersecurity pro worth their salt knows that processes are the foundation for cyber incident response and mitigation. Cyber threats can be complex, multi-faceted monsters and your processes might just be the dividing line between make or break. Your processes not only outline what steps to take in the event of a security breach, they also define who does what and when.

Outlining clear processes ensures your teams are fully prepped for risk management. When business continuity is threatened, your people can fall back on those documented processes to save time, money and the trust of your customers. Your processes will also help to ensure you remain compliant with governing bodies and meet other stringent regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).

Technology
Once you’ve got your people and processes in place, it’s time to figure out which technology tools you want to use to protect your computer systems against threats. In the era of cloud-native infrastructure where remote work is now the norm, protecting against threats is a whole new challenge.

Here are some types of tools you may want to include in your toolkit:

• Encryption tools
• Penetration testing
• Network monitoring
• VPNs
• Threat detection
• Firewalls
• Intrusion detection systems (IDS)
• Packet analyzers
• Vulnerability patching
• Antivirus
• Threat intelligence
• Machine learning/AI threat detection",technical,cybersecurity,
" ABSTRACT
Cyber diplomacy is critical in dealing with the digital era’s evolving cybersecurity dangers and possibilities. This article investigates the impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), Blockchains, and Quantum Computing on cyber diplomacy. AI holds the potential for proactive threat identification and response, while IoT enables international information sharing. Blockchains enable secure data sharing and document verification, but they also pose new threats, such as AI-driven cyber-attacks, IoT privacy breaches, blockchain vulnerabilities, and the potential for quantum computing to break encryption. This article conducts case study reviews in combination with secondary data analysis and emphasises the value of international cooperation in developing global norms and frameworks to control responsible technology adoption. Cyber diplomacy can promote cybersecurity, protect national interests, and foster mutual trust among nations in the digital sphere by capitalising on possibilities and reducing threats.

1. Introduction to cyber diplomacy
1.1. What is cyber diplomacy?
Cyber Diplomacy is a term used to describe the application of diplomatic techniques and negotiations in international relations that deal with and regulate cyberspace-related issues. According to some studies, cyber-diplomacy also covers cyber warfare and agreements on the rules of engagement because without proper rules of engagement, ‘the international community could end up in error with an unwanted conventional or nuclear war’ [Citation1].

Cyber Diplomacy is usually applied to managing the difficulties and obstacles presented by the cyber world and aims to promote responsible actions, preserve cybersecurity, and ensure stability in cyberspace. Without cyber diplomacy in developing national cybersecurity policies, adversaries can apply complex social engineering tactics and present advanced persistent threats and even political threats for national cybersecurity environments [Citation2].

International cooperation is promoted in cyber diplomacy to mitigate mutual threats and challenges. Nations collaborate on developing cyber standards, guidelines, and agreements that support a safe and secure online environment. In 2024, this is specifically focused on artificial intelligence (AI) [Citation3], because AI is simply software, and we have longstanding concerns in regards to ‘artificial intelligence methods in distributed denial of service (DDOS) assault and defense’ [Citation4].

Cyber Diplomacy is used to establish mutually beneficial agreements through diplomatic means of dialogue and to communicate between nations during situations of cyber disagreements between different nations. Cyber Diplomacy is a conflict resolution strategy that attempts to prevent conflicts in cyberspace from developing into bigger geopolitical problems.

International cyber governance, including the development of cyber laws, treaties, and regulations, is significantly influenced by cyber diplomacy. Such governance structures are crucial for preserving order and reducing the risks connected to cyber activity.

Establishing confidence-building measures is a common step in cyber diplomacy, and this is crucial for reaching agreements between nations and fostering mutual trust, reducing scepticism, and increasing openness in individual cyber activities. Such activities might involve information exchange, team training, and hotlines to avoid misunderstandings and errors in judgment.

One of the major issues in cybersecurity is the identification of cyberattacks. Cyber Diplomacy aims to address the attribution problem by building mechanisms to make people accountable for hostile cyber operations. To combat cyber threats effectively, cyber diplomacy promotes cooperation between governments and private corporations because the private sector plays a major part in cyberspace. Hence, public-private collaborations can make the exchange of knowledge and experience in cybersecurity easier.

Cyber Diplomacy promotes capacity building in developing nations to improve their cybersecurity skills and strengths. This assistance can come from sharing expertise, training, and technology transfer. Cyber diplomacy also discusses topics relating to freedoms and rights in cyberspace, including decentralisation and internet governance, freedom of expression, ethics, and privacy. Cyber diplomacy is aimed at creating a balance between individual rights in cyberspace and national security. Table 1 summarises the key roles of Cyber Diplomacy.

Table 1. Key aspects of cyber diplomacy.

Download CSVDisplay Table
In Table 1, we outline the key components and define how cyber diplomacy promotes international agreements, responsible behaviour among states and non-state entities, and cooperation, stability, and security in cyberspace. Cyber diplomacy is essential in determining how the future of the globally interconnected world will be shaped as cyberspace evolves.

1.2. Concepts related to cyber diplomacy
Cyber Diplomacy is strongly related to Cybersecurity, but the two functions are fundamentally different. Cybersecurity prevents unauthorised access, computer hacking, and information theft on computer systems, networks, and databases. Various cybersecurity strategies and technologies are employed to protect data and limit disruptions in cyberspace. While cybersecurity focuses on the technical and operational aspects of securing digital systems, cyber diplomacy deals with the diplomatic implications of managing cyber threats.

Another concept closely related to cyber diplomacy is digital diplomacy. However, the functions are very different. Digital diplomacy, often called e-Diplomacy or Diplomacy 2.0, uses governments’ and diplomats’ social media, online platforms, and digital technology to interact with international audiences, promote communication, and carry out diplomatic outreach. Digital diplomacy is a broader notion that includes technology for diplomatic goals, whereas cyber diplomacy concentrates on cyberspace issues and security.

The third closest concept to Cyber Diplomacy is Cyber Norms. Cyber norms are the established values and guidelines that direct governmental action in cyberspace. These standards seek to mould ethical behaviour and stop malevolent online activity. Cyber Diplomacy is crucial in promoting and negotiating these standards among governments. However, as we can see in Table 1, the Cyber Diplomacy function covers a much greater area.

In Table 2 we summarise the key concepts and functions closely related to Cyber Diplomacy, but they represent very different functions. These functions often confuse people who work in other areas unrelated to cyber.


Table 2. Summary of Cyber functions related to Cyber Diplomacy.

Download CSVDisplay Table
Table 2: Summary of Cyber functions related to Cyber Diplomacy.In recent years, we have seen increased engagements in Cyber Diplomacy from the United Nations, the United States, and the European Union. In 2021, the EU published a new strategy on cybersecurity. In 2022, the US Department of State released a new report on ‘International Norms for State Behaviour in Cyberspace’ [Citation5], and the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution on ‘Principles of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace’ [Citation6]. This year, 2023, the European Union and the United States re-engaged in cyber security dialogue to strengthen cooperation on cyber security issues, such as incident response. The United States also helped first talk with China in over two years on reducing the risk of miscalculation and escalation in cyberspace. Apart from national efforts, there is also a significant effort from non-governmental organisations (NGOs), and businesses operating in related areas.

1.3. Understanding the digital realm’s impact on international relations
The widespread use of the internet and the quick development of technology have radically altered how nations connect and carry out diplomacy. The importance of the online environment in influencing international relations has been demonstrated by several important factors (outlined in Figure 1), and Digital Diplomacy is just one of these factors.",technical,cybersecurity,
" What is Cyber Security?
Cyber security is a discipline that covers how to defend devices and services from electronic attacks by nefarious actors such as hackers, spammers, and cybercriminals. While some components of cyber security are designed to strike first, most of today's professionals focus more on determining the best way to defend all assets, from computers and smartphones to networks and databases, from attacks.

Cyber security has been used as a catch-all term in the media to describe the process of protection against every form of cybercrime, from identity theft to international digital weapons. These labels are valid, but they fail to capture the true nature of cyber security for those without a computer science degree or experience in the digital industry. To gain a deeper understanding and practical skills, consider enrolling in online cybersecurity courses, which are designed to make the complexities of cyber security accessible to everyone.

Cisco Systems, the tech conglomerate specializing in networking, the cloud, and security, defines cyber security as “…the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. These cyberattacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information; extorting money from users; or interrupting normal business processes.”

Why is Cybersecurity Important?
In today’s digital world, one cannot ignore cybersecurity. One single security breach can lead to exposing the personal information of millions of people. These breaches have a strong financial impact on the companies and also loss of the trust of customers. Hence, cyber security is very essential to protect businesses and individuals from spammers and cyber criminals.

The Scale of the Cyber Security Threat
According to Cybercrime Magazine, cybercrime will cost the world $10.5 trillion annually by 2025! Furthermore, global cybercrime costs are predicted to rise by almost 15 percent yearly over the next four years.

Concepts such as the pandemic, cryptocurrency, and the rise in remote working are coming together to create a target-rich environment for criminals to take advantage of.

How Does Cyber Security Work? 
Cyber security encompasses technologies, processes, and methods to defend computer systems, data, and networks from attacks. To best answer the question “what is cyber security” and how cyber security works, we must divide it into a series of subdomains:

Become a Certified Ethical Hacker!
CEH v12 - Certified Ethical Hacking CourseExplore ProgramBecome a Certified Ethical Hacker!
Application Security
Application security covers the implementation of different defenses in an organization’s software and services against a diverse range of threats. This sub-domain requires cyber security experts to write secure code, design secure application architectures, implement robust data input validation, and more, to minimize the chance of unauthorized access or modification of application resources. 

Cloud Security
Cloud security relates to creating secure cloud architectures and applications for companies that use cloud service providers like Amazon Web Services, Google, Azure, Rackspace, etc.

Identity Management and Data Security
This subdomain covers activities, frameworks, and processes that enable authorization and authentication of legitimate individuals to an organization’s information systems. These measures involve implementing powerful information storage mechanisms that secure the data, whether in transition or residing on a server or computer. In addition, this sub-domain makes greater use of authentication protocols, whether two-factor or multi-factor.

Mobile Security
Mobile security is a big deal today as more people rely on mobile devices. This subdomain protects organizational and personal information stored on mobile devices like tablets, cell phones, and laptops from different threats like unauthorized access, device loss or theft, malware, viruses, etc. In addition, mobile security employs authentication and education to help amplify security.

Network Security
Network security covers hardware and software mechanisms that protect the network and infrastructure from disruptions, unauthorized access, and other abuses. Effective network security protects organizational assets against a wide range of threats from within or outside the organization.

Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity Planning
Not all threats are human-based. The DR BC subdomain covers processes, alerts, monitoring, and plans designed to help organizations prepare for keeping their business-critical systems running during and after any sort of incident (massive power outages, fires, natural disasters), and resuming and recovering lost operations and systems in the incident’s aftermath. 

User Education
Knowledge is power, and staff awareness of cyber threats is valuable in the cyber security puzzle. Giving business staff training on the fundamentals of computer security is critical in raising awareness about industry best practices, organizational procedures and policies, monitoring, and reporting suspicious, malicious activities. This subdomain covers cyber security-related classes, programs, and certifications.

What is Cyber Security and Types of Cyber Threats
Cybercrime is defined as any unauthorized activity involving a computer, device, or network. There are three generally recognized classifications of cybercrime: computer-assisted crimes, crimes where the computer itself is a target, and crimes where the computer is incidental to the crime rather than directly related.

Here is a list of common cyber threats:

Cyberterrorism: This threat is a politically-based attack on computers and information technology to cause harm and create widespread social disruption.
Malware: This threat encompasses ransomware, spyware, viruses, and worms. It can install harmful software, block access to your computer resources, disrupt the system, or covertly transmit information from your data storage.
Trojans: Like the legendary Trojan Horse of mythology, this attack tricks users into thinking they're opening a harmless file. Instead, once the trojan is in place, it attacks the system, typically establishing a backdoor that allows access to cybercriminals.
Botnets: This especially hideous attack involves large-scale cyberattacks conducted by remotely controlled malware-infected devices. Think of it as a string of computers under the control of one coordinating cybercriminal. What’s worse, compromised computers become part of the botnet system.
Adware: This threat is a form of malware. It's often called advertisement-supported software. The adware virus is a potentially unwanted program (PUP) installed without your permission and automatically generates unwanted online advertisements.
SQL injection: A Structured Query Language attack inserts malicious code into a SQL-using server.
Phishing: Hackers use false communications, especially e-mail, to fool the recipient into opening it and following instructions that typically ask for personal information. Some phishing attacks also install malware.
Did You Know?
50% of data breach incidents involved phishing and social engineering. 
Man-in-the-middle attack: MITM attacks involve hackers inserting themselves into a two-person online transaction. Once in, the hackers can filter and steal desired data. MITM attacks often happen on unsecured public Wi-Fi networks.
Man-in-the-middle attack: MITM attacks involve hackers inserting themselves into a two-person online transaction. Once in, the hackers can filter and steal desired data. MITM attacks often happen on unsecure public Wi-Fi networks.
Denial of Service: DoS is a cyber attack that floods a network or computer with an overwhelming amount of “handshake” processes, effectively overloading the system and making it incapable of responding to user requests.
As data breaches, hacking, and cybercrime reach new heights, companies increasingly rely on cyber security experts to identify potential threats and protect valuable data. So it makes sense that the cyber security market is expected to grow from $217 billion in 2021 to $345 billion by 2026, posting a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 9.7% from 2021 to 2026.

The Advantages of Cyber Security
Today's cyber security industry is primarily focused on protecting devices and systems from attackers. While the bits and bytes behind these efforts can be hard to visualize, it's much easier to consider the effects. Without cyber security professionals working tirelessly, many websites would be nearly impossible to enjoy due to ever-present denial-of-service attack attempts. Imagine not having access to Simplilearn's community of experts and certified professionals — no more tips, tricks, and advice to help you achieve your professional goals!

Without solid cyber security defenses, it would be easy to destroy modern-day essentials like the power grids and water treatment facilities that keep the world running smoothly.

Simply put, cyber security is critically important because it helps to preserve the lifestyles we have come to know and enjoy.

Cybersecurity Myths
We are well aware that cyberattacks are continuing to grow. In today’s technology era, organizations and individuals must protect themselves against most types of threats. Unfortunately, there is a handful of cybersecurity misconceptions that are still holding too many people back from taking the necessary action to safeguard personal sensitive information. 

Here are some common cybersecurity myths one should know. 

Passwords alone are enough to protect you: one should not solely rely on passwords to keep the data safe. While strong passwords are essential, cybercriminals may still find ways to hack them. Hence it is necessary to implement robust cybersecurity measures, to have a multilayered defense. 
Deleting the file from the computer: By deleting the data from the computer, the file moves to the Recycle Bin and then empties it. Even after deleting the data, the data remains in the hard drive for example in the temporary files folder. 
Encryption solutions are not worth it: Some organizations retain the opinion that encryption software is something they can do without. It is a misconception that encryption will avoid data breaches. Encryption plays a vital role in defending against cybercriminals and ransomware attacks. 
Small and Medium-sized businesses are not targeted: It is a myth that only big companies are not secure, only those companies are targeted by cybercriminals.

" Cyberwarfare and Cyberterrorism
Cyberwarfare, which stands for “electronic warfare,” uses techniques to defend and attack information networks and computers that inhabit cyberspace, often through a prolonged cyber campaign or series of related campaigns. It denies an adversary’s ability to do the same, while using technological warfare tools to attack the adversary’s critical computer systems. Cyberterrorism, on the other hand, is “the use of computer network tools to shut down critical national infrastructure (such as energy, transportation, or government operations) or to coerce or intimidate a government or civilian population.”[12] This means that the end result of both cyberwarfare and cyberterrorism is the same, to destroy critical infrastructure and computer systems interconnected within the confines of cyberspace.

Factors
There are three factors that contribute to why cyberattacks are launched against a nation or individual: the fear factor, the dramatic factor, and the vulnerability factors.

Dramatic factor
The dramatic factor or ""wow factor"" is a measure of the actual damage caused by an attack, meaning that the attack creates direct losses (usually loss of availability or loss of revenue) and receives negative publicity. On February 8, 2000, a denial-of-service attack caused a sharp drop in traffic to several major websites, including Amazon, Buy.com, CNN, and eBay (the attack continued to affect other sites the next day).[13] Amazon reportedly estimated the loss of business at $600,000.

Vulnerability factor
A vulnerability exploits the vulnerability of an organization or government agency to cyber attacks. Organizations that do not have maintenance systems may run on outdated servers that are more vulnerable than updated systems. An organization can be vulnerable to a denial-of-service attack, and a government agency can be defaced on a web page. A computer network attack disrupts the integrity or authenticity of data, usually through malicious code that changes the logic of the software that controls the data, causing errors in output.[14]

Professional Hackers to Cyber ​​Terrorists
Professional hackers, whether they work alone or work for government agencies or the military, can find computer systems with vulnerabilities that lack proper security software. Once these vulnerabilities are found, they can infect the systems with malicious code and then remotely take control of the system or computer by sending commands to display content or to disable other computers. There must be a pre-existing system flaw within the computer for the cyber attack to be successful, such as a lack of antivirus protection or a faulty system configuration for the viral code to work.

Many professional hackers will promote themselves to terrorists online, where a new set of rules governs their actions. Cyber ​​terrorists have deliberate plans and their attacks are not born out of anger. But they also need to develop their plans step by step and have the right software to execute their cyber attack. They usually have political agendas, and target political structures. Cyber ​​terrorists are hackers with political motives, and their attacks can affect the political structure through this corruption and destruction. They also target civilians, civilian interests, and civilian facilities. As previously mentioned, cyberterrorists attack people or property and cause sufficient damage to generate fear and destabilize the security of some entity.

Types of Attack
An attack can be active or passive.

An “active attack” attempts to change or influence the operation of a system’s resources.

A “passive attack” attempts to learn or exploit information from the system, but does not affect the system’s resources (e.g., eavesdropping on telephone conversations).

An attack can be perpetrated and initiated by someone from inside (within the organization being attacked) or from outside the organization;

An “insider attack” is an attack initiated by an entity within the security perimeter (“insider”), that is, an entity that is authorized to access the system’s resources but is using them in a manner not approved by those who granted the authorization.

An “external attack” is initiated from outside the perimeter, by an unauthorized or illegitimate user of the system (“outsider”). On the Internet, potential external attackers range from amateur fraudsters to organized criminals to international terrorists and hostile governments.
The term “attack” relates to some other basic security terms
A resource (either physical or logical), called a presentation asset, can have one or more vulnerabilities that can be exploited by a threat actor in a threatening action. As a result, the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the resource may be compromised. Potentially, the damage extends to resources in addition to those initially identified as vulnerable, including other resources of the organization, and resources of other stakeholders (customers and suppliers).

The so-called CIA triad is the foundation of information security.

An attack can be active when it attempts to change or affect the operation of system resources: A threat threatens the integrity or availability of an information security system. A “passive attack” attempts to learn or exploit information from the system, but does not affect the system’s resources: it therefore threatens the confidentiality standard of the information security system.

A threat is a potential security breach, which occurs when there is a circumstance, capability, action or event that could violate security and cause harm. That is, a threat is a potential risk that could exploit a security vulnerability. A threat can be either “intentional” (i.e., intelligent; for example, an individual hacker or a criminal organization) or “accidental” (for example, a potential computer malfunction, or a potential “natural unintended action” such as an earthquake, fire, or hurricane) or any catastrophic act of natural disasters.

A set of policies related to information security management, namely Information Security Management Systems (ISMS) for managing countermeasures, has been developed according to risk management principles, in order to achieve a security strategy that is developed in accordance with the rules and regulations in force in each country.[15]

The attack must lead to a security incident, i.e. a security event that involves a security breach. In other words, a security-related system event in which the system security policy is disobeyed or breached.

The overall picture represents the risk factors in the risk scenario.[16]

The organization must take steps to detect, classify and manage security incidents. The logical first step is to prepare an incident response plan and eventually a computer emergency response team.

In order to detect attacks, a number of countermeasures can be prepared at the organizational, procedural and technical levels. Examples include (computer emergency response team, IT security audit system and intrusion detection system).[17]

The attack is usually committed by a person with bad and malicious intentions, although attacks based on hatred of blacks also fall into this category, while others perform penetration tests on the organization's information system to see if all expected controls are in place.

Attacks can be classified according to their origin: that is, if they are carried out using one or more computers: in the latter case it is called a distributed attack. Botnets are used to carry out distributed attacks.

Other classifications are based on the procedures used or the type of vulnerabilities exploited, and attacks can focus on network mechanisms or host features.

Some attacks may be physical: stealing or damaging computers and other equipment. Others are attempts to force changes in the logic used by computers or network protocols in order to achieve a result that is unexpected (by the original designer) but beneficial to the attacker. Software used for logical attacks on computers is called malware.

Here is a partial short list of attacks:

Passive attacks:
Computer and network monitoring
Network
Telephone tapping
Fiber tapping
Port scanning
Idle scanning
Host attack
Keystroke logging
Data scraping
Backdoor
Active attacks:
Denial of service attack
A DDoS or Distributed Denial of Service attack is an attempt by an attacker to block access to a server or website connected to the Internet. This is accomplished by using multiple computer systems, which overload the targeted system with requests, making it unable to respond to any query.[18]
Spoofing
Network

Man-in-the-Browser
ARP Poisoning
Ping Flood
Ping of Death
Whale Attack

Intrusion Kill Chain for Information Security [19]
In detail, there are a number of techniques to be used in cyber attacks and a variety of ways to administer them to individuals or organizations more broadly. Attacks are divided into two categories: syntactic attacks and semantic attacks. Syntactic attacks are straightforward. It is considered a malicious program that includes viruses, worms, and Trojan horses.

Syntactic Attacks
Viruses
A virus is a self-replicating program that can attach itself to another program or file in order to reproduce. A virus can hide in unlikely places in a computer system's memory and attach itself to any file it deems appropriate to execute its code. It can also change its digital fingerprint each time it replicates, making it difficult to track it down on a computer.

Worms
A worm does not need another file or program to replicate itself; it is a stand-alone operating program. Worms replicate across a network using protocols. The latest incarnation of worms uses known vulnerabilities in systems to hack, execute, and replicate their code in other systems, such as the Code Red II worm, which infected over 259,000 systems in less than 14 hours.[20] On a much larger scale, worms can be designed for industrial espionage, monitoring and collecting server activity and traffic, and then sending it back to their creator.

Trojans
A Trojan is designed to perform legitimate tasks, but also performs unknown and unwanted activity (malicious activity). A Trojan can be the basis for many viruses and worms that are installed on a computer, such as keyloggers and backdoors. In a commercial sense, Trojans can be embedded in trial versions of software and can gather additional information about the target without the person knowing it is happening. These three can potentially attack an individual and an organization through emails, web browsers, chat clients, remote programs, and updates.

Semantic attacks
A semantic attack is the modification and dissemination of correct and incorrect information. The modified information could have been done without the use of computers although new opportunities can be found using them. To set someone in the wrong direction or to cover your tracks,  Spreading incorrect information can be used.",technical,cybersecurity,
" One of the challenges in writing an article reviewing the current state of cyber education and workforce development is that there is a paucity of quantitative assessment regarding the cognitive aptitudes, work roles, or team organization required by cybersecurity professionals to be successful. In this review, we argue that the people who operate within the cyber domain need a combination of technical skills, domain specific knowledge, and social intelligence to be successful. They, like the networks they operate, must also be reliable, trustworthy, and resilient. Defining the knowledge, skills, attributes, and other characteristics is not as simple as defining a group of technical skills that people can be trained on; the complexity of the cyber domain makes this a unique challenge. There has been little research devoted to exactly what attributes individuals in the cyber domain need. What research does exist places an emphasis on technical and engineering skills while discounting the important social and organizational influences that dictate success or failure in everyday settings. This paper reviews the literature on cyber expertise and cyber workforce development to identify gaps and then argues for the important contribution of social fit in the highly complex and heterogenous cyber workforce. We then identify six assumptions for the future of cybersecurity workforce development, including the requirement for systemic thinkers, team players, a love for continued learning, strong communication ability, a sense of civic duty, and a blend of technical and social skill. Finally, we make recommendations for social and cognitive metrics which may be indicative of future performance in cyber work roles to provide a roadmap for future scholars.

Introduction
The cyber domain is a multi-disciplinary joining of computer science, mathematics, economics, law, psychology, and engineering. It encompasses not only the networking of online devices together, but how humans interact and are influenced by these devices. As such, the cyber domain impacts every facet of modern life from the electricity that powers millions of homes to the transportation network that moves millions of people daily. As the number and uses for connected devices grow, the complexity of cyber infrastructure grows exponentially, as do the number of vulnerable devices. The cybersecurity workforce supports this infrastructure and defends our networks. When discussing the cybersecurity workforce, we limit our scope to focus predominantly on civilian defensive cyber operations (network operations and support), as offensive operations are legally the purview of the military and their study is generally classified and outside the scope of this paper.

This review paper argues that there is a gap in the existing study of the cyber domain and what skills are necessary for a future cyber workforce. Defining the knowledge, skills, attributes, and other characteristics that the nation needs in its cyber workforce is not as simple as defining a group of technical skills that people can be trained on. We need to understand the various work roles, how to optimize team organization to suit current and future task demands, and how each individual cyber professional will fit as part of an organization. This paper proceeds by first defining the cyber domain and identifying gaps in cyber workforce development. We then review extant efforts to define the characteristics of successful individuals and teams in the cyber domain. We follow that by discussing the organizational challenges in hiring and developing cyber talent. We continue by arguing that social attributes such as values and civic duty may be more important in identifying resilient people who will be a fit within their organization as well as possessing the necessary technical abilities (Schwartz et al., 2012). Finally, we discuss six assumptions underlying building effective cyber teams. We conclude with describing possible metrics to assess and develop future cyber professionals.

Because the field is still in its infancy and expanding faster than research can keep pace, much academic work remains undone in understanding who makes a good cyber professional and how do we recruit and find this talent? Due to the paucity of quantitative research, some of the references have been pulled from industry, military, personal experience in cyber operations and other non-peer reviewed sources by necessity. This paper will attempt to fill part of the literature gap by combing insights from organizational management literature as well as tools from social psychology.

To begin, we define the Cyber Domain and identify gaps in our understanding of the domain by looking through a current ontology of work roles and education practices.

Defining the Cyber Domain
The Department of the Army describes the Cyber Domain as a system composed of three layers: the physical layer, the logical layer, and the social layer (TRADOC, 2010). The physical layer consists of the hardware and infrastructure supporting our networks (such as the Internet) as well as the geographic location of where the hardware is located. The logical layer consists of all the logical devices that are connected to each computer network (e.g., anything with an internet protocol address). Finally, the social layer consists of the human and cognitive aspects, including the cyber and actual personas of the people interacting within and between each network.

While most people would readily associate the cyber domain with the physical and logical layers, the social layer is also critical. Entire synthetic worlds are built within the cyber domain (Castronova, 2008), where people have their own (and potentially multiple) semi-unique cyber personas that do not necessarily correspond to their ‘actual’ persona used in real-world social interactions. This complexity of human interactions across layers creates the uniqueness of the cyber domain, and it is understanding these human interactions that create underlying vulnerabilities on the network (Arachchilage and Love, 2013; Shillair et al., 2015). In addition, cyber offensive techniques are often contingent upon exploiting known human behaviors. Therefore, cybersecurity professionals must understand not only the technical aspects of their field but also possess an in-depth knowledge of human interactions (Garvin et al., 2013).

As we will see, social traits have been largely ignored in the context of cybersecurity workforce development. While there is a general appreciation of the social layer in broader cyber operations (e.g., the role of social networking in recent political unrest) and in intelligence analysis, there is less emphasis placed on understanding the role of social traits of the individual cybersecurity professional and their work performance. In essence, social information is seen as a data point for cyber operations rather than also an indicator for success in cyber workforce development.",technical,cybersecurity,
" Work Roles and Training in Cybersecurity
The Department of Homeland Security’s National Initiative for Cybersecurity Careers and Studies (NICCS) developed a Cybersecurity Workforce Framework (Newhouse et al., 2016) to provide a base set of work roles for the cyber workforce. Although this ontology was developed to support US government hiring requirements and was not empirically justified, it represents the most well-documented rostering of work roles in the cyber domain. This collection includes nine work-role categories, 31 specialty areas, and over 1000 types of knowledge, skills, and abilities. Major categories are described in Table 1.

TABLE 1
www.frontiersin.org
TABLE 1. Cybersecurity Workforce Framework.

Securely Provision roles revolve around the more traditional information technology field including software developers, computer programmers, and network architects. The Operate and Maintain roles include System Administrators, Knowledge Management, and Security Analysts. The Oversee and Govern roles include managerial roles, Cyber Law, Policy Development, and Education. The Protect and Defend roles include Cyber Analysts (Operators) and Network Defenders. The Analyze, Collect and Operate, and Investigate roles all encompass the broad field of Digital Forensics and will tend to be government or law enforcement positions (Caulkins et al., 2016).

A limitation of the NICCS Workforce Framework is that, of the 1060 types of knowledge, skills, and aptitudes, fewer than 10 describe social fit or teamwork. This implies that the Framework paints an incomplete picture of workforce proficiency (Seong et al., 2015). We argue that the development of any cybersecurity workforce that neglects the social aspect of human behavior on the network neglects a critical component of the cyber domain. For instance, cultivating talent in the cyber domains involves recognizing that the people who are drawn to this domain may have distinctive social psychological traits and tendencies that make them uniquely suited to excel in this space (Chen and Cotoranu, 2013; Cook, 2014; Dark, 2015; Gonzalez, 2015; Fontenele and Sun, 2016). Furthermore, an understanding of human behavior includes how it introduces risk to the network (Asgharpour et al., 2007; Pfleeger and Caputo, 2012; Arachchilage and Love, 2013; Bell, 2014). Convincing users to engage in best practices relies predominantly on social skill and persuasion (Shillair et al., 2015). Similarly, cyber-attacks are often contingent upon exploiting known human behavior (e.g., phishing attacks; many attacks start with someone opening an infected e-mail; Dodge, 2007) and putting one’s self in another’s shoes (Baker, 2016). In summary, there are numerous social factors that are relevant to workforce development.

Having a baseline set of knowledge, skills, and abilities can go a long way toward developing core attributes common to many work roles. This framework only works if this ontology provides a relatively complete set of essential attributes. NICCS and the National Security Agency have sponsored National Centers of Academic Excellence in Cyber Defense and have identified over 200 colleges and universities in the United States whose cyber curricula align with the cybersecurity knowledge, skills, and abilities in their Cybersecurity Workforce Framework described above. Similar to the limitations of the NICCS framework, these degree granting institutions tend to emphasize technical and electrical engineering skills (Gates et al., 2014) while ignoring the important social and organizational influences that dictate success or failure in everyday settings (Barrick et al., 2003; Meyer et al., 2010). Furthermore, developing the knowledge, skills, and abilities that are needed across teams would arguably provide greater fidelity on the make-up and variety of teams needed to build an effective cybersecurity workforce (Rajivan et al., 2013b; Rajivan, 2014). However, attempting to develop these key baselines without first defining the correct organizational environment will likely only result in a limited ability to produce an effective cyber workforce (Cable and Parsons, 2001; Seong et al., 2015; Frank et al., 2016). In summary, while there are certified degree-granting institutions, we argue that these certifications are based on an incomplete model of work roles and attributes.

While this section tended to lump together all cyber professionals as a holistic classification, it is important to note that there is substantial heterogeneity of work roles and individual National Centers of Academic Excellence due to the rapidly shifting work environments and broad set of skills required across the cyber domain. In a large organization, if a task requires a ‘kernels guy’ then such a person is generally available. Many smaller businesses do not have the ability for a full cybersecurity team and are desperately looking for the non-existent renaissance man. In the following section, we review recent research into attributes that characterize successful cyber professionals and identify several practical challenges for hiring. We then will argue how introducing social and motivational metrics [such as the Five Factor model (FFM) and Schwartz values, respectively] will identify socially aware cyber professionals that can help overcome these challenges.

Characteristics of Successful Cyber Professionals and Teams
The present section is intended to provide an overview of extant research into successful qualities of cyber professionals and the importance of teams in the cybersecurity workforce. Armed with this base knowledge, we will argue that technical knowledge alone is insufficient to develop our workforce. The lack of emphasis on social traits leaves not only a knowledge gap, but also a security and retention gap. We lack the right personnel to communicate cyber threats to less technologically savvy decision-makers in human resource management.

Research in the cyber domain has generally operationalized success using either questionnaires, peer identification, or self-selection (Rajivan et al., 2017). Questionnaires usually define success by using one or more of the following criteria: years of experience, job title, technical competency, and range of competencies (see Ben-Asher and Gonzalez, 2015). Questions regarding the social and organizational fit are notably absent. We believe that with new vulnerabilities constantly emerging, cyber professionals need to have a life-long commitment to learning to stay abreast of new technologies and potential new attack vectors. In fact, the pace of advancement is such that a cyber professional can become substantially less effective with as little as 3 months without supplemental education. Cyber security professionals require continual education to remain proficient. A recent survey found that 69 of 82 professionals reported that informal education supplementation was a prerequisite for career success (Champion et al., 2014). Furthermore, 40% of professionals felt that job experience was the highest factor in positive performance over degree of knowledge/education (12%). Many professionals anecdotally reported that those receiving on-the-job training and mentoring exhibited the highest performance benefits as measured by future career success. Similarly, Asgharpour et al. (2007) found that professionals who subjectively rated themselves with higher levels of expertise tended to have both more and more diverse competencies than those with less self-professed expertise.

In terms of work role performance, much of the extant research is based on network security tasks such as intrusion detection. In general, cyber professionals in the Securely Provision, Operate and Maintain, and Protect and Defend work roles must have good mental flexibility and pattern matching abilities (Champion et al., 2014; Ben-Asher and Gonzalez, 2015; Baker, 2016). They will have to possess significant skill and knowledge about computer operating systems and using analytical tools for such things as network scanning, network mapping, and vulnerability analysis. This task environment involves scanning large numbers of network events and (generally false) alerts across multiple computer screens with the goal of identifying threats while minimizing false alerts (D’Amico et al., 2005; D’Amico and Whitley, 2008). Furthermore, cognitive task analyses have identified that network analysts need to exhibit strong situational awareness (Jajodia et al., 2010; Dutt et al., 2013), including juggling concurrent sources information regarding the health of the network, historical and current network activity, and performing a continual assessment of risk (Mahoney et al., 2010; Shin et al., 2015). For recent meta-analyses see Onwubiko and Owens (2011); Franke and Brynielsson (2014), and Liu et al. (2017). One limitation of intrusion detection is that it is a very specialized work role whose skills may not transfer to broader cybersecurity work roles. Through the use of structured interviews, Goodall et al. (2009) interviewed twelve cyber professionals and identified that the requirement for situated knowledge (i.e., knowledge of the local environment) made intrusion detection a relatively unique task and challenging to transfer expertise to other tasks in the cyber domain.

By virtue of the complexity of the task environment, cyber professionals need to work in teams (Mathieu et al., 2000). We have argued that in the military context, cyber teams tend to be teams of diverse talents. However, in the private sector it is much more likely for smaller teams to be composed of similarly talented individuals rather than a group with diverse work roles and backgrounds (Champion et al., 2012). Recent research has identified that cybersecurity teams are better able to solve complex tasks than individual analysts, potentially due to the distribution of expertise across analysts (Rajivan et al., 2013a,b; Rajivan, 2014; Rajivan and Cooke, 2018). For instance, performance on incident triage was highest with a diverse group of heterogeneous talents as opposed to a team with members of similar background and skills (Rajivan et al., 2013b). A limitation of research into cyber teamwork is that they have not examined different organizations of teams or combinations of teams. This future research is essential to determine the correct make-up of the future cyber workforce.

The previous sections have provided an overview of cyber work roles, cyber education, and recent research into defining successful cyber professionals and teams. A recurring theme is the focus on technical aspects of cyber workforce development, which leads to a knowledge gap, and we argue that closing this knowledge gap is essential to meet the demands of the future cyber workforce. The current common understanding of technical aspects of the cyber domain are often viewed separately from the social aspects occurring in the domain. This creates incomplete spheres of knowledge (Shin et al., 2015). We argue that the development of any cyber workforce that neglects the social aspect of human behavior on the network neglects a critical component of the cyber domain. Development of a future cyber workforce that accounts for both technical and social skills will likely produce the kind of expertise that enables true creativity and excellence in performance (Gates et al., 2014). Even more than a knowledge gap, the remainder of this section will argue that a focus on technical skills leads to a potential retention and security gap as well.

The Implied Problem of the Cyber Workforce
Part of the problem for cyber professionals and the companies looking to hire them is that very few individuals outside of the tech industry understand the complexity of the cyber domain. Despite this, the vast majority of companies utilize the cyber domain for logistics, communication, human resources management and a wide variety of other functions. As a result, companies looking to hire cyber professionals are working outside of their core competencies and therefore may not be able to develop a good sense of person-organization fit (Cable and Parsons, 2001). Additionally, human resources may not understand the language needed to appropriately advertise for the knowledge, skills, and attitudes they are looking for due to the complexity of the cyber domain (Baker, 2016). Finally, in an era of ever tightening budgets, many companies may want to hire a single professional as opposed to a team in order to keep costs contained (Srinidhi et al., 2015) or may seek to contract out the work without fully understanding their own needs.

Because cyber work is difficult to understand, cyber workers must develop an ethical code similar to other professions. This creates a potential opportunity for exploitation, both from bad actors and from disgruntled employees or even from employees who mean well (Umphress and Bingham, 2011). The complexity of the domain means that there must be a high level of trust between cyber professionals and their employers. This increases the difficulty in hiring in today’s job economy where people are hired for skillsets rather than values. It is particularly important that future cyber professionals then be linked to a values system that prevents them from taking advantage of their employers’ lack of understanding. We argue that this values system should be encoded in the norms of the cyber domain as well as encoded in law, to give it the force of a sense of duty obligation but also to ensure that failures can be legally enforced (Hannah et al., 2014).

This makes explicit a latent underlying assumption about the relationship between the technically competent ground-level cyber professionals and the relative Luddites in upper management. This relationship is essentially a bargain that is anchored in the idea that the rest-of-the-world will allow the cyber workforce to conduct daily business, largely based on the assumption that cyber professionals will conduct their duties in good faith. This assumption exists, in our experience and in consultation with key decision-makers in industry, primarily because many key decision-makers (especially in small to mid-sized businesses) do not understand the nature of the complexity of the work roles and tasks within the cyber domain.

We argue that cyber leadership must have technical knowledge that is broader rather than more in depth but must also possess enough expertise in domain-specific knowledge that their subordinates take them seriously. In the case of Google, their managers have a depth of technological knowledge but also critically include individual traits in their assessment of how their managers are performing (Garvin et al., 2013). Managers and leaders also are critical in establishing the culture of the workplace that enables the attraction of future employees.

The problems posed by the complexity of the cybersecurity domain are not going to be solved just by requiring an emphasis on soft skills as opposed to technical skills. This is a problem of translation. How does communication occur between the Luddites and cyber workforce if the Luddites are unable to understand the technical complexity of the cyber workforce? Does this create a paradigm shift in power at a local and global level where the technocrats end up in charge because the Luddites lack understanding of the cyber domain? Rather than prognosticate on the future of political change and technology’s role therein, in the following section we will review research from the organizational management and personality literature to suggest social requirements for the future cyber workforce.

Person-Organization Fit and its Application to Cybersecurity Roles
The current section provides a brief review of core social theories and how they may apply to the cybersecurity workforce. These theories include person-organization fit, the five-factor model of personality characteristics, and Schwarz values theory. Each provides a different perspective on how to match prospective cybersecurity professionals with their best role, and whether a technically competent professional is a good fit for a given organization. This is because, in addition to technological and social skills, a future cyber workforce must also be reliable and trustworthy.

The research on person-organization (P-O) fit argues that individuals select certain organizations based on how well they perceive it will match with their knowledges, skills, values, and interests (Cable and Parsons, 2001). The individual organizational literature argues that individuals are likely to seek out organizations and vocations that match their values and allow for vocational satisfaction (Barrick et al., 2003; Kristof-Brown et al., 2005; De Cooman et al., 2009). From a P-O fit perspective, organizations look to hire folks who will match their organizational climate. Google is famous for hiring tech professionals who also have a certain “googleyness” (Garvin et al., 2013). One of the biggest challenges for hiring a future cyber workforce is that the requirements are going to be needed at a wide variety of organizations. Police will need to hire individuals with cyber capabilities that also fit within a police department’s unique culture. Hospitals will need to hire individuals who can navigate the complexities of the hospital communications networks as well as can interact with non-cyber medical professionals. Examples like these suggest that the people hired into these positions must understand both the technical aspects of the cyber domain (Gates et al., 2014) and the social aspects of their jobs (Ono et al., 2011) as well as the situational dynamics within each organization (Meyer et al., 2010).

This does not mean that it is impossible to identify individuals who will fit in multiple areas within the cyber domain. However, it does suggest that there will not be a one size fits all cyber education program for all organizations. The implications for attraction, selection, and attrition models of person-organization fit suggest that like the cyber domain itself is both physical and logical, individuals drawn to the cyber workforce may be drawn to certain aspects of a specific segment of the industry. Identifying the individual aspects such as Big Five Personality traits as well as Organizational Types could go a long way to helping identify individuals who may thrive in different segments of the cyber domain. Furthermore, identifying strong and weak organizations may also help provide clarity for what traits are likely to be activated within specific areas within the cyber domain (Meyer et al., 2010)

We turn now to a discussion of Big Five Personality traits and the possible impact on the development of a future cyber workforce. This section provides a discussion of a possible framework to use in order to better understand the makeup of the cyber workforce. Because cyber calls for both technical and social skills, a new map of occupational types may be required to better identify the types of jobs within the cyber domain. Because of the complexities and the multiple layers of technical and additional skills required in the cyber domain, identifying people who fit into more central FFM/occupational type topologies may go a long way toward identifying people who are more adaptable to success in the cyber domain. It is not implying that the cyber workforce must conform to the Occupational Types or FFM, nor is it saying that the Occupational Types or FFM are the best way to understand the topology of the cyber workforce. Instead, this is meant to provide discussion of a way to understand the cyber domain. Future research should investigate occupational specialties within the cyber workspace in order to determine within domain occupational classifications.",technical,cybersecurity,
" Organizational Type and the Big Five Personality Tests
The FFM has been broadly matched to vocational interests (Barrick et al., 2003). FFM hold that there are five global characteristics of personality. Extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, emotional stability, and openness to experience provide “a parsimonious taxonomy” regarding aspects of “broad constructs of personality which enables them to exhibit high cross-situation reliability” (Barrick et al., 2003, p. 47). Combined with vocational interests, personality constructs offer an explanatory account of how our patterns of behavior and our likes and dislikes interact to account for vocational preferences and potentially work performance. Applying this framework to the emerging cyber domain offers the ability to understand which types of people are drawn to certain aspects of the cyber domain.

Holland’s vocational interests argues for creating a typology of personality and organizations which then can better predict which employees will remain with an organization as opposed to attrite (Holland, 1996). Applying this topology to the cyber domain may offer the ability to better understand the types of people and occupations that are emerging. Holland’s theory states “that an employee’s satisfaction with a job, as well as propensity to leave that job, depends on the degree to which the individual’s personality matches his or her occupational environment” (Barrick et al., 2003, p. 46). The RAISEC model refers to “six work environment types – realistic, investigative, artistic, social, enterprising, and conventional (Barrick et al., 2003, 47). Realistic work environments involve “systematic manipulation of machines or animals” whereas enterprising are typically geared toward achieving organizational goals and maximizing profit. Investigative work environments tend to draw people who are “curious, methodological, and precise” whereas artistic work environments attract people who are “non-conforming and original” (Barrick et al., 2003, p. 47). Conventional organizations are focused on filing, organizing and what is typically conceptualized as bureaucratic work (Barrick et al., 2003, p. 47). This paper argues that understanding the type of occupational work required of future cyber workers as well as understanding the personality traits of individuals drawn to a different domain within the cyber workforce will provide valuable insight into selecting individuals with the potential to excel across the cyber domain.

Work on applying Holland’s organizational types has not been applied to the different types of cyber organizations but some inferences can be drawn. This paper argues that since there is a fundamental lack of understanding of the content of the current cyber workforce, using Holland’s occupational types and FFM may offer insights into understanding the different types of indivduals who are drawn to different occupational domains within the cyber domain. From a building a cyber workforce perspective, the intersection of Holland’s occupational types and FFM provides interesting insights. Computer specialists are anomalous in where they fall in the Holland Occupations Structure. They are actually centrally located in the occupation hexagon – meaning they have tendencies from all the work environment types (Knafo and Sagiv, 2004). This suggests that people with the technical aptitude for work in the cyber domain may not fit in any of the classic FFM/Occupational type topologies. Future research should investigate occupational specialties within the cyber workspace in order to determine whether new domain occupational classifications are needed for the cyber domain.

Pure cognitive ability may provide insight into the ability to learn domain specific knowledge and thus the development of expertise (Lizardo and Strand, 2010). High levels of cognitive ability should not be misconstrued as academic achievement, however (Spiro, 1988; Krawczyk et al., 2013). Academic achievement varies with personality types and vocational preferences also vary between academically talented and the less academically inclined. However, in heavily social occupations such as law enforcement, cognitive ability is only weakly associated with performance (Ono et al., 2011). It is likely that cognitive ability may provide insight into the ability of a future cyber workforce’s aptitude for learning the technical aspects of the cyber domain but neglecting the social aspects will likely result in a lack of explanatory power related to performance.

The Big Five Personality tests have widespread construct validity and a long research tradition but when it comes to predicting workplace performance, it has been criticized as lacking predictive power. For example, research regarding the FFM traits and criminal investigator training reveals that FFM is only loosely correlated with success (Ono et al., 2011). Personality and vocational interest have clear correlations but the basis for this is not well understood. Despite this lack of theoretical understanding for the basis of this correlation, this correlation does have “important implications for understanding work outcomes” (Barrick et al., 2003, p. 49). Personality constructs such as FFM may offer valuable insights into what types of people select into specific cyber occupations but combing this with values influence on vocational selection may offer additional insight into how individuals select future occupations in this emerging domain. We turn now to briefly review the role of values on occupational interest.

Values and Vocations
The influence of values on occupational interest, selection and retention has a long tradition in the organizational literature. Values are trans-situational constructs that orient behavior toward desired goals and outcomes (Bardi and Schwartz, 2003; Schwartz et al., 2012). Individuals are attracted to organizations that they believe reflect their values or are likely to match their interests. Additionally, if individuals find an organization does not correspond with their values, they are significantly more likely to attrite and find a better fit (Cha and Edmondson, 2006; De Cooman et al., 2009). For the cyber domain, values are potentially even more important than in other professions for several reasons. As previously mentioned, the technical knowledge that cyber professionals possess is likely much deeper than the average worker. This means that they must be trusted with their employers’ primary communications, logistics, human resource, and other critical infrastructure and resources. Second, by understanding the values that motivate individuals to select certain cyber occupations, we may be able to find those diamonds in the rough and steer potential professionals to occupations that best match their skill set. In addition, by finding those whose values do not match, we may be able to weed out potential threats (Cook et al., 2012).

Schwartz values (see Figure 1) have been widely cross culturally tested and have an extensive research tradition validating the construct. Schwartz values map motivational aspirations and goals consisting of competing and complementary alignments (Bardi and Schwartz, 2003; Knafo and Sagiv, 2004; Schwartz et al., 2012). These values may be used to distinguish the kinds of values that differentiate workers in different workplaces, such as differences between private sector and military employment. This is especially important as many military cyber professionals turn to lucrative jobs in the private sector upon their departure from the military. This change in culture and values may cause friction if the professionals’ values are incompatible with those of the private sector.

FIGURE 1

FIGURE 1. The circular structure of Schwartz values.

Interestingly, the same phenomenon with realistic occupations seen in the Holland RAISEC research occurs again with the Schwartz values framework. Notably, the realistic occupations are near the center of the FFM/occupational type (Barrick et al., 2003). Likewise, when the Schwartz values framework was tested with the occupational types, realistic occupations such as electrician, computer specialists, and engineer were all near the center of the two dimensional graph of values and occupational types (Knafo and Sagiv, 2004). This suggests that the values that drive people to select certain occupations may be a weaker influence than other value/occupational type pairing.

While the current section has focused on several social theories which may provide key insight into cybersecurity workforce development, these theories have been criticized as only having weak correlations with outcomes due their inability to account for situations or organizational forces. Therefore, we turn now to a discussion of organizational/situational strength and its possible impact on development of a cyber domain workforce.

Situational Strength as a Predictor of Fit
Organizational forces have strong influence on individual behavior. Therefore, any development of a cyber workforce must account for the breadth and variety of organizations encompassed in the cyber domain. It is possible that accounting for situational strength may fill in missing information in the personality/organizational type paradigm that then better predicts workplace performance. Defining organizational context and situations as weak or strong could go a long way to identifying individuals who will be successful in different segments of the cyber domain beyond personality traits and organizational types (Cook et al., 2012; Judge and Zapata, 2015).

There is a long history in the social sciences about the influence of the situation on individual behavior. Sociologists Emile Durkheim and Max Weber both conceptualized how the social forces such as religious ceremonies and bureaucratic rules both limit and enable individual freedoms (Weber, 1947; Durkheim, 1996). Situational strength “gives us the ability to conceptualize how much individual traits such as FFM [or Schwartz values] may be constrained or activated” (Meyer et al., 2010, p. 122). Individual difference may manifest differently depending on situational and organizational influences. Mischel’s work makes the critical argument that “traits cannot be studied in a vacuum” (Meyer et al., 2010, p. 123). Any attempt to develop a cyber workforce must account for organizational context and situational strength. While FFM/vocational types can provide valuable insights, without organizational contexts, they may provide less accurate or relevant information regarding future workplace performance.

Organizational context can be expected to provide similar patterns of performance, regardless of individual differences. Put another way, a cyber officer in the military will behave similarly regardless of individual personality traits because of their being embedded in the military context. For example, a cyber workforce that consults with other agencies may find themselves in weak situations – that is they less structured, have greater ambiguity in the rules and lower thresholds of normative behavior (Caspi and Moffitt, 1993). This may result in a cyber employee having greater flexibility in identifying problems and making recommendations that are less constrained by organizational forces. A cyber officer in the military, however, is more likely to encounter strong situations, which suggests that individual personality may be less predictive of success or organizational fit than in less defined situation (Knafo and Sagiv, 2004; Judge and Zapata, 2015).

Understanding how situations may interact with personality to activate certain traits may offer greater explanatory power than merely organizational type and FFM on their own (Judge and Zapata, 2015). For example, an air traffic controller position may activate traits associated with greater attention to detail. Likewise, a cyber defense analyst may activate innovation or creativity. Understanding which traits are activated within the different sub domains within the overarching cyber domain. There are limited testing capacities to understanding the types of situations the future cyber workforce may find itself in, but it warrants further investigation. Cyber events may be ambiguously structured resulting in uncertainty in how to categorize them (Meyer et al., 2010). In an ambiguously structured cyber event, individual differences and individual experience may be the most likely to effect behavior. Conversely, cyber events may also follow predictable patterns that are clearly identified and therefore provide clarity in how to respond. In stronger situations, individual differences are less likely to manifest and influence workplace performance. A theory of strong or weakly constructed cyber events would help in the development of assessments for a future cyber workforce.

There are four possible theoretical constructs available to better define situational strength within organizations. Clarity, consistency, consequences, and constraints all act in ways that inhibit personality traits from activation. Clarity provides structure in processes and procedures as well as clear hierarchy. Within the cyber domain, clarity should identify best practices without being overly strict. Best practices should not become encoded rules or laws in order to prevent undue rigidity. Consistency in information flow also restricts individual differences. Cyber organizations should identify how information is likely to be accessed as well as accounting for who needs to receive it during routine events as well as during emergencies (Meyer et al., 2010). Constraints involve the decision makers. This is one of the most important areas for cyber organizations to consider – the decision makers should be those individuals with enough expertise to understand the nature of the problem/situation but with enough power to ensure that resources and attention are appropriately applied (Srinidhi et al., 2015). Finally, consequences should be well developed both broadly and locally as well as personally and organizationally significant. Put another way, the consequences for an individual’s email being hacked may be very insignificant. But if that individual is connected to other more important individuals, their email may provide vulnerabilities. Likewise, consequences that are less likely but catastrophic should be well known by all decision makers and employees involved in the decision tree (Greve et al., 2010).

To date, we have argued that any workforce development devoid of an understanding of social aspects only paints an incomplete sphere of knowledge. We have shown how current education and training practices exhibit a gap in identifying social traits. We then reviewed three social theories as potential avenues for future research into cyber workforce development: person-organization fit, the five-factor model of personality, and value theory. Each provide a different mechanism for not only matching personality to work roles, but also to the precise organizations where a cyber professional may work. In the following section, we identify six traits which we believe are necessary for the future cyber workforce.

Key Traits in the Future of the Cyber Workforce
As we have seen, there is little empirical information on what makes a good cyber professional. When discussing cyber, people often point to Google and discuss how effective they are at hiring people who have the right amount of “googleyness.” The cyber domain is much broader than a single company and is far too broad to enable a single defining set of skills. It touches every aspect of daily life from ubiquitous activities such as purchasing gasoline to more immersive activities like online gaming that develop around entire virtual worlds. We hypothesize six traits which we believe are requirements for the future cyber workforce. While future research may invalidate some or all of these hypotheses, in the interest of providing a testable framework, we challenge future researchers to empirically test each hypothesis. These hypotheses have been derived from the prior literature review and personal experience in and around cyber operations.

Systemic Thinkers
Cyber is not a domain in the classic sense of the word in that there is no way to physically see or touch the varying elements that comprise it. That said, the complexity and multiple layers of it make it unlike any other system. The physical layer is made up of hardware and cables but the layers built on top of that create a complexity that is rivaled by few other systems in the modern world. The interconnectedness of the cyber domain means that anyone working in the field needs to have an ability to step back from the specific piece for the equipment they are working on and consider the interconnections they may not physically be able to see or touch. Just as employees need to understand how their actions in their own email account can have second order effects across their network, employees in the cyber domain need to understand the different systems that may be impacted by a single software upgrade. Cook (2014) argues that the ability to approach the cyber domain as a system of systems will require a different mental agility and conceptual framework than previously required. Also, the Army Cyber Branch Annex (2017) also highlights that systemic and creative thought were highly valued traits in cyber officers.

Team Players
While anyone working in the modern workforce should be comfortable working with others, there is a unique challenge with the cyber domain and building effective teams. Given the current albeit limited emphasis on cyber skills focusing on the technical and engineering domains, there has been little insight into what attributes make up a high performing cyber team. The sheer magnitude of the complexity of the cyber domain increases the likelihood that a future cyber workforce is going to be working more in teams and less on their own. A current challenge with cyber security teams is that they tend to operate as a cluster of individuals in a group (Champion et al., 2014) rather than exhibiting the cohesion and trust that involves a shared sense of identity (Gilson et al., 2015; Seong et al., 2015).

Technical and Social Skill
The limited research that exists regarding skills, attributes, and knowledge in the cyber domain tend to focus overly on the technical aspects, ignoring the critical piece in the cyber system: the people. End users are the single most exploitable vulnerability in the areas of cyber defense (Julisch, 2013; Buchanan and Sulmeyer, 2016) and any future development of a cyber domain workforce must consider the additional competencies necessary to accomplish their tasks. For example, a cyber defense worker needs to consider all the ways their coworkers could be exploited by a malicious entity as well as be able to communicate the vulnerability in a way that is easily understood by laymen.

Civic Duty
Insider threats are the largest vulnerability on any network and can do the irreparable damage. There is extensive research on values and vocational fit, however, the future cyber workforce must be more loyal to the ideals of the country and organization that he or she belongs to (Cook et al., 2012). Given the sensitivity of data that the cyber workforce will have access to, as well as the lack of knowledge of their superiors and their coworkers, the future cyber workforce is going to have to engender trust. Commitment to the organizational values as well as a national sense of pride and identity may go a long way in mitigating (Knafo and Sagiv, 2004).

Continued Learning
Given the rapid rate that technology changes, the future cyber workforce may be operating on outdated knowledge the moment they graduate from their degree granting institution (Cook, 2014). They will not be able to rest on their laurels, so to speak but will have to constantly be seeking out the latest information about security, network vulnerabilities, and latest capabilities (Champion et al., 2014). This will require a passion for learning and solving puzzles and a willingness to figure out the problem.

Communications
We argue, albeit with limited evidence, that not only will the future cyber workforce need increased emotional intelligence, but they will need to be able to communicate technical information to an audience that may not have a technical background. They will need to be able to discuss requirements with budget personnel in order to obtain new resources and be able to explain to their supervisor why a certain idea may be catastrophic. If they are unable to communicate clearly, in a manner that is easily understood, they will be significantly less effective in accomplishing their critical tasks.

Any of these assumptions may prove invalid with the advent of future research. However, they are necessary to help shape expectations and develop a common language about why the authors recommend the tools they do. Having set these general hypotheses, we now conclude by discussing some paths forward to support further researchers investigating the future cyber workforce.

Concluding Thoughts and Paths Forward
Any cyber workforce development plan is going to have to confront the complexities of the cyber domain as well as be able to adapt with the complexity of the cyber domain. Developing the network requires different knowledge, skills, and abilities than defending the network, even though, doing one is dependent up on understanding the other (Shin et al., 2015). Defending the network requires thinking through vulnerabilities as though one were going to attack the network (Baker, 2016). Finally, in addition to the technical aspects, any effective cyber workforce is going to have to develop a deep understanding human behavior both online and in real life (Choo, 2011; Julisch, 2013; Buckels et al., 2014).

Cyber professionals are embedded within the organizational structure and impacted by situational strength. A military cyber officer is going to work in a stronger situation and clearly defined organizational structure than a cyber professional at Google (Judge and Zapata, 2015). The values that are effective in the military cyber environment may not be effective at Google and in fact, may be counterproductive.

Acknowledging baseline standards would go a long way to developing initial capabilities that can be groomed and developed into more specialized skills that are organizationally dependent (Lizardo and Strand, 2010). Attempting to develop these key baselines without first defining the organizational environment will likely only result in a limited ability to produce an effective cyber workforce. Furthermore, developing standards that are needed across teams would arguably provide greater fidelity on the types and make-up of teams needed to build an effective cyber workforce (Mathieu et al., 2000).

A critical problem with developing a baseline of cyber skills, however, is the over emphasis on technical skills such as computer sciences or electrical engineering (Gates et al., 2014). While technical skills are an important aspect of knowledge within the cyber domain, it is only one aspect. Cyber threat detection requires knowledge not only of technical vulnerabilities (Choo, 2011) but in understanding how everyday user behavior increases network vulnerabilities (Arachchilage and Love, 2013). Convincing users to engage in best practices, as opposed to actively working against network security officers is a skill set that relies more on social skill and persuasion than technical skill (Shillair et al., 2015). Criminal investigations is another area within the overarching cyber domain that is both technical and investigative (Ono et al., 2011) and relies more on social skill than raw cognitive ability.

Finally, despite the modern phenomenon of accreditation and certification that has led to the rise of more people going to college, the best cyber workforce may have skills that are not adequately captured on standardized tests and certification processes. Mental agility and cognitive flexibility are aspects of personality (Spiro, 1988) and have the potential, when matched with information about the organizational type and situation strength, to offer more predictive power than personality type alone. In fact, standardized tests may actively discourage the exact type of mental flexibility individuals need to be effective in the ever-changing cyber domain (Lovaglia et al., 1998). One hiring executive at Cisco remarked that he was more concerned with whether potential hires would read a manual and try to solve a problem on their own rather than come in knowing all aspects of their job. Technical capacity can be built whereas willingness to acknowledge what someone doesn’t know is harder. Another senior leader was more concerned with teamwork and ability to learn the technical aspects than purely technical ability.

We believe that the path forward requires a re-evaluation of the cyber workforce with the goal of empirically measuring not only technical aptitudes, but organizational and social fit. We need to go beyond structured interviews to determine the cognitive underpinnings of expertise to determine the correct work roles where an individual may be predisposed to succeed. In addition, the cyber domain is so new that we also need sociologists and organizational management researchers to develop paradigms for assessing team performance in the complex and constantly evolving cyber defense landscape. Perhaps the ideal cyber workforce is higher in pure cognitive ability and lower on any personality traits or aspirational values. If this is the case, then cognitive assessments may be highly predictive of career success in many cyber work roles. If organizational fit is most important – because middle management and key decision-makers must understand the problems that cyber professionals endeavor to communicate – then purely cognitive indicators may not be that predictive of future performance.

We argue that future research should focus on three key areas. First, researchers should survey current workers in various organizations within the cyber domain to establish what personality traits and values are present in the current work force. Second, this research should map current cyber jobs with the Holland occupational types to identify how cyber occupations map onto more traditional understandings of occupational types, and even if there is something ‘special’ about cyber work roles that would require an addendum to Holland or a new classification system. Third, these occupations should be mapped onto situational strength. This new data should be used to validate whether personality constructs, Schwartz values constructs, occupational type, and situational strength can be used as part of the set of tools to identify future cyber workers that will fit within an organization.

In summary, we have identified a gap in research into cyber workforce development, cyber education, and cyber expertise, where technical skills are being examined without putting the potential cyber professional’s personality and social traits in context. We argue that this creates an incomplete sphere of knowledge with regards to understanding what makes a good cyber professional. We also reviewed several methodologies from personality and organizational management in an attempt to fill this gap, and presented a series of six hypotheses to spawn further research into the future of the cyber workforce.",technical,cybersecurity,

" What is cybersecurity?
Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting internet-connected systems such as hardware, software and data from cyberthreats. It's used by individuals and enterprises to protect against unauthorized access to data centers and other computerized systems.

An effective cybersecurity strategy can provide a strong security posture against malicious attacks designed to access, alter, delete, destroy or extort an organization's or user's systems and sensitive data. Cybersecurity is also instrumental in preventing attacks designed to disable or disrupt a system's or device's operations.

An ideal cybersecurity approach should have multiple layers of protection across any potential access point or attack surface. This includes a protective layer for data, software, hardware and connected networks. In addition, all employees within an organization who have access to any of these endpoints should be trained on the proper compliance and security processes. Organizations also use tools such as unified threat management systems as another layer of protection against threats. These tools can detect, isolate and remediate potential threats and notify users if additional action is needed.

Cyberattacks can disrupt or immobilize their victims through various means, so creating a strong cybersecurity strategy is an integral part of any organization. Organizations should also have a disaster recovery plan in place so they can quickly recover in the event of a successful cyberattack.

How to develop a cybersecurity strategy: Step-by-step guide
Why is cybersecurity important?
With the number of users, devices and programs in the modern enterprise increasing along with the amount of data -- much of which is sensitive or confidential -- cybersecurity is more important than ever. But the volume and sophistication of cyberattackers and attack techniques compound the problem even further.

Without a proper cybersecurity strategy in place -- and staff properly trained on security best practices -- malicious actors can bring an organization's operations to a screeching halt.

What are the elements of cybersecurity and how does it work?
The cybersecurity field can be broken down into several different sections, the coordination of which within the organization is crucial to the success of a cybersecurity program. These sections include the following:

Application security.
Information or data security.
Network security.
Disaster recovery and business continuity planning.
Operational security.
Cloud security.
Critical infrastructure security.
Physical security.
End-user education.
Maintaining cybersecurity in a constantly evolving threat landscape is a challenge for all organizations. Traditional reactive approaches, in which resources were put toward protecting systems against the biggest known threats while lesser-known threats were undefended, are no longer a sufficient tactic. To keep up with changing security risks, a more proactive and adaptive approach is necessary. Several key cybersecurity advisory organizations offer guidance. For example, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) recommends adopting continuous monitoring and real-time assessments as part of a risk assessment framework to defend against known and unknown threats.

What are the benefits of cybersecurity?
The benefits of implementing and maintaining cybersecurity practices include the following:

Business protection against cyberattacks and data breaches.
Protection of data and networks.
Prevention of unauthorized user access.
Improved recovery time after a breach.
Protection for end users and endpoint devices.
Regulatory compliance.
Business continuity.
Improved confidence in the company's reputation and trust for developers, partners, customers, stakeholders and employees.

What are the different types of cybersecurity threats?
Keeping up with new technologies, security trends and threat intelligence is a challenging task. It's necessary in order to protect information and other assets from cyberthreats, which take many forms. Types of cyberthreats include the following:

Malware is a form of malicious software in which any file or program can be used to harm a user's computer. Different types of malware include worms, viruses, Trojans and spyware.
Ransomware is a type of malware that involves an attacker locking the victim's computer system files -- typically through encryption -- and demanding a payment to decrypt and unlock them.
Social engineering is an attack that relies on human interaction. It tricks users into breaking security procedures to gain sensitive information that's typically protected.
Phishing is a form of social engineering in which fraudulent email or text messages that resemble those from reputable or known sources are sent. Often random attacks, the intent of phishing messages is to steal sensitive data, such as credit card or login information.
Spear phishing is a type of phishing that has an intended target user, organization or business.
Insider threats are security breaches or losses caused by humans -- for example, employees, contractors or customers. Insider threats can be malicious or negligent in nature.
Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks are those in which multiple systems disrupt the traffic of a targeted system, such as a server, website or other network resource. By flooding the target with messages, connection requests or packets, DDoS attacks can slow the system or crash it, preventing legitimate traffic from using it.
Advanced persistent threats (APT) is a prolonged targeted attack in which an attacker infiltrates a network and remains undetected for long periods of time. The goal of an APT is to steal data.
Man-in-the-middle (MitM)) attacks are eavesdropping attacks that involve an attacker intercepting and relaying messages between two parties who believe they're communicating with each other.
SQL injection is a technique that attackers use to gain access to a web application database by adding a string of malicious SQL code to a database query. A SQL injection provides access to sensitive data and enables the attackers to execute malicious SQL statements.",technical,cybersecurity,

" Why Is Cybersecurity Important?
Why is Cybersecurity Important
The increasing reliance on technology in today's world has made protecting sensitive information a more critical priority than ever before. From personal data to financial transactions, cyberthreats can disrupt businesses and impact individuals globally. Cybersecurity is an industry that encompasses various measures and practices that safeguard computer systems and networks from unauthorized access, damage or theft, and it involves implementing strong security protocols, complex encryption methods and proactive countermeasures.

By prioritizing cybersecurity, organizations can mitigate the risk of data breaches, financial losses and reputational damage. Whether you're an individual or an organization, understanding the importance of cybersecurity is fundamental to navigating the threat landscape safely and securely.

Understanding the Importance of Cybersecurity
With the vast amount of information available on cybersecurity, it’s sometimes easy to forget exactly why it’s important in the first place.

Cybersecurity is important for two very human reasons:

Our identities are increasingly shifting online. From credit agencies and workplaces to the social media networks we use daily, our lives are becoming more intwined with the digital world.
The supply chains that keep us fed and clothed are all managed through information technology.
As of October 2023, data breaches have exposed over 600 million records. The impact of major data breaches involving sectors and organizations, such as Healthcare, Twitter and MOVEit (customers), means something more than just having to change your password.

This means that individuals and groups are targeting the technology that essentially defines and supports you in the modern world. They are targeting systems that contain your personal data. In other words, attackers worldwide are targeting you. That’s why safeguarding our information systems is imperative.

Power, Presence and Privacy: Three Essential Factors
Information security is all about three key factors: power, presence and privacy. Modern technology is incredibly powerful, and the typical mobile device is more powerful than a traditional PC.

Additionally, tech is everywhere. We’re now wearing technology, like smart watches, which have the ability to gather sensitive data wherever we go. Cybercriminals are eager to obtain this information, and as a result, organizations that collect this data are held to strict standards.

What’s at Stake With Securing Data?
Primary Data vs Metadata
People truly love Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Designed to simplify people’s lives—from turning on lights around the house to ordering household essentials with a voice command—IoT devices make everything more convenient. However, these devices gather sensitive information and data about the users who actively rely on them. A portion of this information is called primary information, because it’s directly about you and your identity. This is also known as primary data or personally identifiable information (PII).

Here are some examples of primary information:

Username
Passwords
Bank account information
Credit card information
Social security numbers
Your health
Your purchasing choices
When combined, and in the wrong hands, this data can often lead to identity theft. When this data is captured, stored and processed, it is often called data analytics or business intelligence (BI).

IoT and other devices also capture indirect information about you, which is often called metadata. This data, which is seemingly insignificant, is generated as you and your devices move from place to place.

For example, contact-tracing applications and typical mobile devices are all capable of capturing this metadata. Metadata can include the cell phone towers and devices that your mobile phone or smart watch has connected to, the ISP you are currently using and your location.

Each time you connect to a Wi-Fi hotspot, an organization is collecting your data. This can include both the primary and secondary data you generate, all of which can be analyzed. This analysis allows organizations to make highly accurate guesses about your interests, future activities and even intentions. The responsibility to ensure that this personal information remains private, secure and ethically used lies with cybersecurity and privacy professionals, as well as the leadership of the organizations that collect this data.

" Cyber threats to the financial system are growing, and the global community must cooperate to protect it

In February 2016, hackers targeted the central bank of Bangladesh and exploited vulnerabilities in SWIFT, the global financial system’s main electronic payment messaging system, trying to steal $1 billion. While most transactions were blocked, $101 million still disappeared. The heist was a wake-up call for the finance world that systemic cyber risks in the financial system had been severely underestimated.

Today, the assessment that a major cyberattack poses a threat to financial stability is axiomatic— not a question of if, but when. Yet the world’s governments and companies continue to struggle to contain the threat because it remains unclear who is responsible for protecting the system. Increasingly concerned, key voices are sounding the alarm. In February 2020, Christine Lagarde, president of the European Central Bank and former head of the International Monetary Fund, warned that a cyberattack could trigger a serious financial crisis. In April 2020, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) warned that “a major cyber incident, if not properly contained, could seriously disrupt financial systems, including critical financial infrastructure, leading to broader financial stability implications.” The potential economic costs of such events can be immense and the damage to public trust and confidence significant.

Two ongoing trends exacerbate this risk. First, the global financial system is going through an unprecedented digital transformation, which is being accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Banks compete with technology companies; technology companies compete with banks. Meanwhile, the pandemic has heightened demand for online financial services and made work-from-home arrangements the norm. Central banks around the globe are considering throwing their weight behind digital currencies and modernizing payment systems. In this time of transformation, when an incident could easily undermine trust and derail such innovations, cybersecurity is more essential than ever.

Second, malicious actors are taking advantage of this digital transformation and pose a growing threat to the global financial system, financial stability, and confidence in the integrity of the system. The pandemic has even supplied fresh targets for hackers. The financial sector is experiencing the second-largest share of COVID-19–related cyberattacks, behind only the health sector, according to the Bank for International Settlements.


Who is behind the threat?
More dangerous attacks and ensuing shocks should be expected in the future. Most worrisome are incidents that corrupt the integrity of financial data, such as records, algorithms, and transactions; few technical solutions are currently available for such attacks, which have the potential to undermine trust and confidence more broadly. The malicious actors behind these attacks include not only increasingly daring criminals—such as the Carbanak group, which targeted financial institutions to steal more than $1 billion during 2013–18—but also states and state-sponsored attackers (see table). North Korea, for example, has stolen some $2 billion from at least 38 countries in the past five years.


This is a global problem. While cyberattacks in high-income countries tend to make headlines, less attention is paid to the growing number of attacks on softer targets in low- and lower-middle-income countries. Yet it is in those countries where the push toward greater financial inclusion has been most pronounced, leading many to leapfrog to digital financial services such as mobile payment systems. Although they do advance financial inclusion, digital financial services also offer a target-rich environment for hackers. The October 2020 hack of Uganda’s largest mobile money networks, MTN and Airtel, for example, resulted in a major four-day disruption of service transactions.


The responsibility gap
Despite the global financial system’s increasing reliance on digital infrastructure, it is unclear who is responsible for protecting the system against cyberattacks. In part, this is because the environment is changing so quickly. Without dedicated action, the global financial system will only become more vulnerable as innovation, competition, and the pandemic further fuel the digital revolution. Although many threat actors are focused on making money, the number of purely disruptive and destructive attacks has been increasing; furthermore, those who learn how to steal also learn about the financial system’s networks and operations, which allows them to launch more disruptive or destructive attacks in the future (or sell such knowledge and capabilities to others). This rapid evolution of the risk landscape is taxing the responsiveness of an otherwise mature and well-regulated system.

Without dedicated action, the global financial system will only become more vulnerable as innovation, competition, and the pandemic further fuel the digital revolution.
Better protecting the global financial system is primarily an organizational challenge. Efforts to harden defenses and toughen regulation are important but are not enough to outpace the growing risks. Unlike many sectors, most of the financial services community does not lack resources or the ability to implement technical solutions. The main issue is a collective action problem: how best to organize the system’s protection across governments, financial authorities, and industry and how to leverage these resources effectively and efficiently.

The current fragmentation among stakeholders and initiatives partly stems from the unique aspects and evolving nature of cyber risk. Different communities operate in silos and tackle the issue through their respective mandates. The financial supervisory community focuses on resilience, diplomats on norms of state behavior, national security agencies on trying to deter malicious activity, and industry executives on firm-specific rather than sector-specific risks. As lines between financial services firms and tech companies become ever more fuzzy, the lines of responsibility for security are likewise increasingly blurred.

The disconnect between the finance, the national security, and the diplomatic communities is particularly pronounced. Financial authorities face unique risks from cyber threats, yet their relationships with national security agencies, whose involvement is necessary to effectively tackle those threats, remain tenuous. This responsibility gap and continued uncertainty about roles and mandates to protect the global financial system fuel risks. Part of this uncertainty is due to the current geopolitical climate and high levels of mistrust, which hinder collaboration among the international community. Cooperation on cybersecurity has been hampered, fragmented, and often limited to the smallest circles of trust because it touches on sensitive national security equities. International and multi-stakeholder cooperation is not a “nice-to-have” but a “need-to-have.”


An international strategy
To achieve more effective protection of the global financial system against cyber threats, the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace released a report in November 2020 titled “International Strategy to Better Protect the Global Financial System against Cyber Threats.” Developed in collaboration with the World Economic Forum, the report recommends specific actions to reduce fragmentation by fostering more collaboration, both internationally and among government agencies, financial firms, and tech companies.

The strategy is based on four principles: first, greater clarity about roles and responsibilities is required. Only a handful of countries have built effective domestic relationships among their financial authorities, law enforcement, diplomats, other relevant government actors, and industry. Existing fragmentation hampers international cooperation and weakens the international system’s collective resilience, recovery, and response capabilities.

Second, international collaboration is necessary and urgent. Given the scale of the threat and the system’s globally interdependent nature, individual governments, financial firms, and tech companies cannot effectively protect against cyber threats if they work alone.

Third, reducing fragmentation will free up capacity to tackle the problem. Many initiatives are underway to better protect financial institutions, but they remain siloed. Some of these efforts duplicate each other, increasing transaction costs. Several of these initiatives are mature enough to be shared, better coordinated, and further internationalized.

Fourth, protecting the international financial system can be a model for other sectors. The financial system is one of the few areas in which countries have a clear shared interest in cooperation, even when geopolitical tensions are high. Focusing on the financial sector provides a starting point and could pave the way to better protection of other sectors in the future.

Among actions for strengthening cyber resilience, the report recommends that the FSB develop a basic framework for supervising cyber risk management at financial institutions. Governments and industry should strengthen security by sharing information on threats and by creating financial computer emergency response teams (CERTs), modeled on Israel’s FinCERT.

Financial authorities should also prioritize increasing the financial sector’s resilience against attacks targeting data and algorithms. This should include secure, encrypted data vaulting that allows members to securely back up customer account data overnight. Regular exercises to simulate cyberattacks should be employed to identify weaknesses and develop action plans.

To reinforce international norms, the report recommends that governments make clear how they will apply international law to cyberspace and strengthen norms to protect the integrity of the financial system. The governments of Australia, The Netherlands, and the United Kingdom have already taken a first step with statements indicating that cyberattacks from abroad may be regarded as illegal use of force or intervention in the domestic affairs of another state.

Cyber resilience and strengthened international norms can facilitate collective response through law enforcement actions or multilateral reaction with industry. Responses can include sanctions, arrests, and asset seizures.

Governments can support these efforts by establishing entities to assist in assessing threats and coordinating responses. Intelligence gathering should include a focus on threats to the financial system, and governments should share such intelligence with allies and like-minded countries.


Building capacity
The comprehensive strategy outlined in the Carnegie report depends in turn on building the cybersecurity workforce, expanding the financial sector’s cybersecurity capacity, and safeguarding gains in financial inclusion that have resulted from the digital transformation.

Elevated unemployment due to the pandemic provides an important opportunity for training and hiring talented people to strengthen the cybersecurity workforce. Financial services firms should invest in initiatives to build the talent pipeline, including high school, apprenticeship, and university programs.

Building cybersecurity capacity means focusing on providing assistance where it is needed. The IMF and other international organizations received many requests for cybersecurity assistance from member states, particularly following the 2016 Bangladesh incident. G20 governments and central banks could create an international mechanism to build cybersecurity capacity for the financial sector, with an international agency such as the IMF designated to coordinate the effort. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and international financial institutions should make cybersecurity capacity building an element of development assistance packages and should significantly increase assistance to countries in need.

Finally, maintaining progress in financial inclusion requires strengthening connections between financial inclusion and cybersecurity. This is particularly urgent in Africa, with many countries on the continent experiencing a significant transformation of their financial sectors as they extend financial inclusion and move to digital financial services. A network of experts should be created to focus specifically on cybersecurity in Africa.

The time has come for the international community—including governments, central banks, supervisors, industry, and other relevant stakeholders—to come together to address this urgent and important challenge. A well-thought-out strategy, such as the one above, provides a blueprint for turning words into action.",technical,cybersecurity,

" As Southeast Asia propels forward in its digital transformation, it inevitably faces accompanying threats to its growth. The region has long acknowledged the imperative to safeguard its digital economy from cyber-attacks, exemplified by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime’s report indicating a staggering 600% increase in cyber-attacks in 2021.

Fortunately, this recognition has spurred the region into action. Southeast Asia has proactively devised collaborative plans to fortify its digital landscape, striving to create a peaceful, secure, and resilient cyberspace.

The first ASEAN Cybersecurity Cooperation Strategy from 2017-2020 laid the groundwork towards one shared goal— a safe cyberspace. Similarly, the ASEAN Information and Communications Technology (ICT) Masterplans aimed to fortify the protection of networks and services.

However, despite having a roadmap and updated strategies, many hurdles still decelerate the region’s cybersecurity development. These obstacles include uneven capacity development, lack of standardisation, and limited information-sharing mechanisms.

In an age where cyber threats are on the rise, is being “secure” enough? Are existing policies sufficient to protect the future digital landscape?

Current Regional Challenges
Southeast Asian countries are in varying stages of cyber capability and digital development. The disparities present problems for coordination and communication regarding cross-border threats and crimes.

Although there are existing ASEAN cooperation strategies and master plans, these mainly focus on capacity-building rather than policy development and coordination. These measures may be helpful to countries in their early stages but not those that have already established their domestic policies. For example, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, and the Philippines have established policies to safeguard their governments, citizens, and businesses against evolving cyber threats. In contrast, Vietnam and Indonesia are in the early stages of implementing measures to enhance the protection of their digital economy, with room for improvement. These differences are expected, reflecting the diverse stages of digital development and cyber capability across the region.


Moreover, the lack of a unifying framework created difficulties for the region’s interconnected infrastructures and economies. The countries become more vulnerable to the same threat actors since they have no system for incident reporting and data collection.

Hence, with a great chance of facing and experiencing the same cyber-attacks, Southeast Asia needs to develop common strategies, enact unified standards, and enhance regional cybersecurity and cyber resilience.

Cybersecurity to Cyber Resilience
Contrary to common belief, cybersecurity and cyber resilience are closely related yet entirely different. According to the International Telecommunications Union (2023), cybersecurity is the tools, policies, and guidelines used to protect an organisation’s assets.

Meanwhile, cyber resilience is the ability to anticipate, attack, withstand, recover from, and adapt if the assets are compromised. Cyber resilience encompasses the capacity to anticipate, withstand, recover from, and adapt to compromises in digital assets. In contrast, cybersecurity primarily deals with preventing and detecting breaches, while cyber resilience focuses on enhancing systems post-breach. Rooted in the acknowledgment that attacks are inevitable and threat uncertainties persist, cyber resilience requires continual development.

Shifting the discourse to cyber resilience enables Southeast Asian nations to formulate forward-looking policies. Governments, policymakers, business leaders, and individuals can prioritise ongoing development and evolution to match the rapid pace of evolving cyber threats.

A United Nations University study assessing 14 cybersecurity strategies in the Asia Pacific region revealed that while the term “cyber resilience” is commonly used, few countries have operationalized its meaning. Singapore, for instance, has clearly defined resilience in its national strategy, while Malaysia, although not explicitly using the term, underscores the importance of business continuity. Encouraging a shift in perspective towards “cyber resilience” emphasises not just protective measures but also the significance of adaptive efforts.

In the Tech For Good Institute’s research, our proposed Cyber Resilience Framework does not seek to reinvent the wheel; instead, it builds upon established frameworks. Embracing the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development‘s definition of resilience as “the ability of individuals, communities, and states and their institutions to absorb and recover from shocks, whilst positively adapting and transforming their structures and means for living in the face of long-term changes and uncertainty”, our framework represents a reconceptualisation rather than a complete overhaul of principles.

What distinguishes our proposed framework is its emphasis on states not only rebounding after an attack but also advancing and consistently seeking improvements in their systems. It strives for a balanced approach that acknowledges the importance of not just recovery but continuous enhancement.


Building Resilience, Securing Future
Today, the conversations remain focused on preventing and detecting a breath rather than improving the systems once breached. However, understanding the difference and elevating the conversations from cyber security to cyber resilience is a must to combat cyber-attacks.

Southeast Asian nations can chart a course towards a more secure digital future by formulating forward-looking policies that engage governments, policymakers, business leaders, and individuals collaboratively. Given the dynamic nature of emerging threats in the digital economy, fostering cooperation across these sectors is paramount. Notably, the considerable variability in cyber resilience among ASEAN member states underscores the necessity for a shared framework establishing cybersecurity standards. Such a framework would not only fortify individual states against potential vulnerabilities but also contribute to the collective strength of regional efforts in cyber resilience. Regular reviews of this regional baseline are essential to ensure its ongoing relevance and efficacy.

Addressing the widening gap in the cybersecurity workforce demands concerted efforts through public-private partnerships and increased investment. The proposed Cyber Resilience Framework provides a strategic guide for countries to identify priority areas for investment, allowing them to tailor their focus based on specific domains that offer the greatest potential for growth. For instance, Indonesia and Vietnam can concentrate on domains enhancing their defences against cyber threats, while Thailand and the Philippines may prioritise improving adaptability.

In bolstering cyber resilience, countries contribute not only to their individual prosperity but also to the overall security of the regional digital landscape. The 2018 ASEAN Leader’s Statement on Cybersecurity Cooperation aptly underscores the significance of a “peaceful, secure, and resilient cyberspace” as a foundational element for economic progress.

" What is Cyber ​​Security?
Cyber ​​security is known as a field of information technology, also known as information security, in which individuals, institutions and systems are protected from digital hacking, unauthorized access or serious security threats that may affect the privacy of data and information, especially sensitive ones, as well as the management of the production process itself, especially since industries of all kinds are now closely linked to technology.

The main goal behind the emergence of cyber security is the emergence of what are known as dangerous digital attacks or immune viruses, in which the digital systems of individuals or the facility are attacked and the sensitive data they possess is controlled, and they are subjected to blackmail and theft operations, as well as deliberate sabotage of information.

As a result of the huge losses caused by these attacks, cyber security has emerged, not only for the purpose of defending or protecting against harmful computer attacks, but also for the purpose of carrying out a deliberate attack in which vulnerabilities in the system are discovered and worked on to fix them immediately upon their discovery.

The field of cybersecurity is usually associated with some of the terms related to each other, such as cybercrime and cyberattacks: in which illegal planning is carried out using digital technology to control a device or system belonging to an individual or institution, using advanced devices or exploiting system vulnerabilities, or depending on the user's ignorance and lack of technological culture.

The importance of cybersecurity
Cybersecurity is important due to the high financial cost allocated to repelling cyberattacks of various types, as the average budget spent to repel attacks is $ 17 million.

There are more than 21.1 billion devices connected to the Internet around the world, which is equivalent to 21.1 billion potential attacks in the world of cyberspace, which in turn is what could happen if it were not for cybersecurity and its vital developments that are occurring in a successive and rapid manner at the present time.

The importance of cybersecurity lies in the fact that it maintains the sensitivity and security of users' private information, especially that which may expose people to danger or the countries in which they reside, because any information that may be marginal or unimportant to some individuals may be the link that a hacker needs to do his job.

Cybersecurity helps countries maintain the confidentiality of their information from being hacked by hostile countries or being exposed to cyber attacks that cause paralysis or scandalous losses to their economy, which in turn can be imagined as a type of modern warfare in our current era.

Cybersecurity also helps develop cloud services technology because the presence of a wall that protects the privacy of the data stored in it makes users more confident in its efficiency and more invested in spending money on it with ease.

Paying attention to the cybersecurity of websites and services helps give service providers an additional competitive advantage, so that users tend to deal with secure websites, especially those that require payment gateways or sharing sensitive data or personal information.

Cybersecurity helps protect users from illegal activities that occur on the dark web, most of which are life-threatening or expose the browser to legal accountability, not to mention the ethical aspect as well.

Therefore, the field of cyber security is linked to four basic concepts: cyber crime, cyber attacks, cyber deterrence, and cyber space. The areas of work vary between:

1. Application security

2. Cloud security

3. Financial security in financial transactions

4. Security in the critical infrastructure of the system

5. Information and data security

6. Network security

7. Operational security

8. End-user security awareness

9. Disaster recovery, especially those related to cyber attacks or natural causes

Types of cyber security

1- Network security:

Most attacks that occur are via electronic networks, so security systems have been put in place that act as a safety valve for the network. These systems ensure immediate solutions and complete control over data elements and access to the network, in order to prevent any attacks that attempt to steal or damage the data stored on their servers.

2- Cloud Security:

Since the prevailing trends now for most organizations around the world are to use artificial intelligence technology and storage clouds, it has become necessary to secure the digital cloud because it contains a huge amount of data for these organizations, and a group of companies specialized in this field provide services to solve this crisis, such as Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure.

3- Application Security:

Web applications are like anything else directly connected to the Internet, so it is logical that they are threatened by attacks on their cybersecurity, and this type of cybersecurity helps companies and organizations discover sensitive data that must be protected from expected attacks, through anti-virus programs, firewalls, and information encryption processes.

4- IoT Security:

Although the use of IoT devices (such as smart devices, AI tools, and sensitive sensors across a single global network) provides many productive benefits, it exposes organizations to cyber threats. IoT security protects them by discovering connected devices and classifying them according to their operational role in addition to the extent of the authority granted to access the database. When any unusual movement is sensed, it controls network activities and monitors any exploitation of these devices at runtime and deals with them.

5- End-user Security:

Endpoint security is a set of featuresTechnology Arsat is used to protect end-user devices from cyber attacks that are caused by malicious and unwanted programs, such as desktop and laptop computers, and mobile phones, which employees use to access company networks and access multiple resources, so organizations seek to protect these devices in order to prevent any external attempt to access networks and databases stored on company servers. 6- Infrastructure Security:

Infrastructure security of organizations is defined as a security measure based on protecting the system's vital infrastructure and reducing vulnerabilities in these systems from corruption, sabotage and terrorism, such as network communications, data center, server or IT center, and an emergency plan is put in place in the event that the company's systems are targeted by cybercriminals. The vital infrastructure includes the following:

1) Power supply and transmission systems

2) Water supply

3) Cooling system

4) Heating and air circulation

7- Disaster recovery related to cyber attacks or natural causes:

Disaster recovery or business continuity in the conditions of recovery from cyber attacks is the process of resuming business after a database is damaged, and depending on the size, scope and business of the company, different plans are set to help employees communicate and continue to perform their jobs in the event of an attack.

8- Information and Data Security:

Information security is the process of designing and deploying tools to protect your business's critical information from destruction, disruption or alteration. It is the critical factor in ensuring cybersecurity. It is specifically designed to maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of business data, and ensure that only authorized applications and systems can access certain information. It also plays a pivotal role in monitoring and investigating potential malicious behavior, trying to contain threats and respond promptly to incidents while preserving evidence for potential prosecution.

9- Financial Security:

Some people think that cybersecurity and data security are not related to the accounting cycle, but due to the threats of hacking the company's financial data, which can include errors and unintentional data breaches, the financial security system was created and innovative solutions were provided in the event that databases were attacked by cybercriminals, and data protection from financial threats and violations that threaten livelihoods, business growth, customer relationships and more.

" Introduction

In today’s computerized world, new risks emerge every hour of every day. Connecting to the Internet opens up the possibility of a hacker targeting your organization. Cybercrime is becoming big business and cyber risk a focus of organizations and governments globally. Monetary and reputational risks are high if organizations don’t have an appropriate cybersecurity plan.

Cybersecurity and data breaches continue to be on the rise and impact organizations of all sizes and sectors. The latest Hiscox Cyber Readiness Report 2023 reveals that cyber-attacks have been steadily climbing for four consecutive years, with a notable surge in targeting smaller businesses, reaching as high as 36%. According to Statista, the manufacturing sector experienced the greatest proportion of cyber-attacks compared to other industries in 2022, closely followed by finance and insurance. Recent cases have involved thefts of sensitive information, resulting in significant financial losses for affected companies.

What is Cybersecurity?

Cybersecurity is making sure your organization's data is safe from attacks from both internal and external bad actors. It can encompass a body of technologies, processes, structures, and practices used to protect networks, computers, programs, and data from unauthorized access or damage. The goal of any cybersecurity strategy is to ensure confidentiality, data integrity, and availability.

There are several primary means by which cybersecurity issues can affect (or even destroy) an organization and its reputation. There is the risk that a hacker might obtain sensitive information such as bank account or credit cards details. There are open markets for such information on the “dark web”. If others access such sensitive information, the organization might find its banking or credit card facilities withdrawn or in breach of privacy laws. Each month high-profile security breaches impacting individual data are reported globally.

A second but related issue is that when a hacker obtains sensitive information about the organization it may find its reputation ruined. Few small organizations can survive the damage to its reputation that such lost data might cause. The damage to reputation and goodwill might be more crippling than the actual data loss itself. Loss of customer data may result in legal or regulatory action against the organization. A third party might file a suit against an organization as they have themselves incurred a loss. Organizations might also be subject to significant penalties and/or legal action arising from breaches of the privacy laws in many jurisdictions.

The most recent and alarming aspect of cybersecurity that causes considerable problems for organizations is ransomware. As early as 2012, reports of ransomware campaigns have adopted commercially focused business models. In many cases, a piece of malware is disguised and embedded within another type of document only waiting to be executed by the target user. Upon execution, the malware may encrypt the organization’s data with a secret 2,048-bit encryption key or communicate to a centralized command and control server to await instructions carried out by the adversary. Once infected, the organization’s data continues to be inaccessible as the encrypts the data using the attackers encryption key. Once all the data accessible is encrypted, including in many instances the backup data and systems, the organization will be instructed on how to pay a ransom within days, or the adversary will remove the encryption key and the data will be lost. Literally, the adversary holds the data to ransom—hence, ransomware. The encryption key is sufficiently strong enough that cracking the key instead of paying the ransom is uneconomic—some estimate that an average desktop computer would take five quadrillion years to decrypt the data without the key In some cases, the target organization can hope that some researchers may have discovered a way to decrypt the data based on a design flaw. Otherwise the organization will have to look to restore the systems and data from a safe back up or consider paying the ransom. Keep in mind that even data restoration does not eliminate the risk the ransomware will not be reenabled or return based on the compromised integrity of the environment.

Cybersecurity Governance

A cybersecurity governance and risk management program should be established which is appropriate for the size of the organization. Cybersecurity risk needs to be considered as a significant business risk by the owners and directors. This should be at the same level as compliance, operational, financial and reputational risks with suitable measurement criteria and results monitored and managed.

There are voluntary frameworks which can be used to consider the risk assessment and related best practices. For example, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework includes five concurrent and continuous functions:

Identify: Develop an organizational understanding to manage cybersecurity risk to systems, people, assets, data and capabilities.
Protect: Develop and implement appropriate safeguards to ensure delivery of critical services.
Detect: Develop and implement appropriate activities to identity the occurrence of a cybersecurity event.
Respond: Develop and implement appropriate activities to take action regarding a detected cybersecurity incident.
Recover: Develop and implement appropriate activities to maintain plans for resilience and to restore any capabilities or services that were impaired due to a cybersecurity incident.
Protection from Malicious Software and External Attack

New threats continue to emerge and each organization needs to be sure it is equipped to deal with a dynamic threat landscape. The following are some of the more critical system utilities and solutions used to help mitigate these malicious attacks:

Firewalls are software (and also hardware) designed to protect the system from attack from people accessing the organization’s systems via both internal and external communication links.
Malware/spyware and web proxy protection solutions protect the system from software code that may be from pop-up windows or have more insidious intent, such as logging usernames and passwords for fraudulent purposes.
Anti-spam software protects email inboxes from being clogged by unwanted broadcasted email.
Anti-phishing software protects users visiting websites that are designed to trap user information that can then be used for fraudulent purposes.
All are mandatory for any well-managed system utilizing a defence in depth strategy. The cost of an attack can be significant, involving loss of data, fraud, and the cost of rebuilding systems and should be analysed against the cost to defend against such threats.

It is recommended to use a well-known, reputable supplier. Some companies purport to supply these utilities but in fact the utilities themselves can be malicious software. Be cautious about using free software or software from an unknown vendor. Generally, it is best to use the utilities recommended by the business’s systems integration (technical support) organization, as they will be responsible for its installation, configuration, and maintenance.

Maintenance of these applications is critical. New malicious software emerges every day. Most software vendors provide at least a daily automatic update to their databases to ensure that the system continues to be effectively protected. Ensuring that these updates are correctly implemented is essential.

Hardware Maintenance Plans

Maintenance contracts should be maintained with hardware suppliers so that hardware failures can be quickly rectified. These contracts should specify the service levels that the supplier will meet in the event of failure. Critical hardware such as servers, switches, and backup technologies require prompt attention. Many contracts specify four-hour response for failure of these components. Other, less critical hardware such as individual workstations can have longer response times.

Some organizations, particularly in remote areas, purchase some critical components that have a higher potential to fail, such as power supplies, as spare parts that can quickly replace a failed component. Organizations that rely on maintenance contracts should ensure that the support company maintains an adequate supply of spare components to meet the organizations service level commitments.

The quality of the organization’s external IT support company is critical in ensuring the systems are correctly implemented and supported. Issues that need to be considered in selecting an appropriate company include:

Their knowledge and experience with the organization’s hardware and operating system configuration.
Their knowledge and experience with the organization’s application software.
Certifications held with major hardware and software companies, which provides an assurance as to the competency of the people in the organization.
The number of people within the company who have the required knowledge to support the system—this is critical as a reliance on a single individual can result in significant delays and cost should that individual be unavailable for any reason.
Their ability to provide support services remotely to enable rapid response to issues at a reasonable cost.
Proper due diligence and vendor risk management to ensure that the third party is providing the services based on the organizations expectations.
People and Documentation

Every organization should establish a plan to mitigate the risk of key people being unavailable in the event of a system failure. Keep a list of contact details for backup technicians. Document the configuration of hardware and software applications and keep this up to date so that a new technician can quickly rebuild the system.

Policies and Procedures

Proper IT governance procedures within an organization are critical. Implement a formal risk assessment process and develop policies to ensure that systems are not misused and ensure that applicable policies are continually reviewed and updated to reflect the most current risks. This includes developing incident response policies and procedures to properly respond to, account for and help mitigate the cost of a potential breach.

Ongoing education to all employees on technology risks should form part of the organizations risk management framework, with potential security breaches being mitigated as a result of education and policies being promulgated to all levels of staff. Policies should include but are not limited to:

User Account Management: rules and policies for all levels of users; procedures to ensure the timely discovery of security incidents; IT systems and confidential data are protected from unauthorized users.
Data Management: establishing effective procedures to manage the repositories, data backup and recovery, and proper disposal of media. Effective data management helps ensure the quality, timeliness, and availability of business data.
IT Security and Risk Management: process that maintains the integrity of information and protection of IT assets. This process includes establishing and maintaining IT security roles and responsibilities, polices, standards, and procedures.
Individual jurisdictions are likely to have enacted legislation that may require particular policies, or issues within a particular policy, to be addressed. Common policies are listed below and cover system use, e-mail use, internet use and remote access.

System Use Policy

A system use policy generally outlines the rules by which the organizations IT systems can be used. Example elements to be considered in this policy include:

Mandatory use of passwords on all systems, such as phones and tablets, including the need for passwords to be changed regularly and a prohibition of providing passwords to other team members or third parties.
Prohibition of copying organization data and removing the data from the office without approval.
The encryption of memory/USB sticks.
The physical security of equipment.
Use of the system during business hours.
Rules for the private use of the system, if allowed, outside office hours.
Multifactor authentication - using more than one method of authentication from independent categories of credentials to verify the user’s identity for login.
Email Use Policy

Example elements to be considered in an e-mail use policy include:

Prohibiting the use of personal email accounts for business matters.
Prohibiting opening email attachments from unknown sources (as they may contain malicious software).
Prohibiting accessing email accounts of other individuals.
Prohibiting sharing email account passwords.
Prohibiting excessive personal use of the organization’s email.
Notification that the organization will monitor email.
Internet Use Policy

Example elements to be considered in an internet use policy include:

Limiting Internet use to business purposes.
Notification of the ability of the organization to track Internet usage.
Prohibiting access to sites that are offensive to a person’s gender, sexuality, religion, nationality, or politics.
Ensuring that downloads occur only from a safe and reputable website.
Prohibiting downloading executable (program) files as they may contain malicious software, and also prohibiting downloading pirated music, movies, or software.
Prohibiting providing the user’s business email address in order to limit the likelihood of spam.

" Cyber security definition
Cyber security is the practice of defending computers, networks, and data from malicious electronic attacks. It is often contrasted with physical security, which is the more traditional security practice aimed at controlling access to buildings and other objects in the real world.

Although there are plenty of high-tech physical security techniques, and sometimes physical and cyber security are joined together in the org chart under the same executive, cyber security focuses on protecting assets from malicious logins and code, not burglaries.

Types of cyber security
Cyber security is a broad umbrella term that encompasses a number of specific practice areas. There are a number of ways to break down the different types — Kapersky Labs has one schema, Mindcore another — but here are the most prominent types you’ll hear about:

Network security prevents and protects against unauthorized intrusion into corporate networks
Application security makes apps more secure by finding and fixing vulnerabilities in application code
Information security, sometimes also referred to as data security, keeps data secure from unauthorized access or alterations, both when it’s being stored and when it’s being transmitted from one machine to another
Operational security, often abbreviated as OPSEC, is a process by which organizations assess and protect public data about themselves that could, if properly analyzed and grouped with other data by a clever adversary, reveal a bigger picture that ought to stay hidden
Some aspects of disaster recovery are also considered to lie under the cyber security umbrella; in particular, techniques to remediate widespread data loss or service outages as a result of a cyber attack are part of the larger cyber security discipline
Examples of cyber security threats
Each of the types of cyber security combat cyber security threats within a specific conceptual realm. Cyber attacks have come a long way since the days of  phone phreaking of the ’70s; modern threats include:

Malware
Denial of service attacks
Phishing
Ransomware
SQL injection
Cross-site scripting
Man in the middle attacks
Credential stuffing
The goal of each discipline within cyber security is to face these threats—and new ones that might emerge in the future—in a systematic way, largely by preparing for attacks before they happen and providing as little attack surface as possible to an attacker.

Cyber security frameworks
One of the ways in which you can lay this groundwork is to adopt a cyber security framework. This isn’t some whiz-bang software tool or hardware appliance; it’s a set of policies and procedures meant to improve your organization’s cyber security strategies. These frameworks are created by various cyber security orgs (including some government agencies) to serve as guidelines for organizations to improve their cyber security.

Any cyber security framework will provide detailed direction on how to implement a five-step cyber security process:

Identifying vulnerable assets within the organization
Protecting assets and data, and taking care of necessary maintenance
Detecting breaches or intrusions
Responding to any such breaches
Recovering from any damage to systems, data, and corporate finance and reputation that result from the attack
Cyber security frameworks can become mechanisms by which government security regulations are imposed. Both HIPAA and GDPR, for instance, contain detailed cyber security frameworks mandating specific procedures companies covered by the laws have to follow.

Of course, most cyber security frameworks are not mandatory, even ones developed by governments. One of the most popular of these is NIST’s Cybersecurity Framework, version 1.1 of which was released in April of 2018. This framework has been mandated for use within U.S. federal agencies and is increasingly popular elsewhere, with voluntary takeup from banks, energy companies, defense contractors, and communications companies.

1. Malware
Malware — or malicious software — is any program or code that is created with the intent to do harm to a computer, network or server. Malware is the most common type of cyberattack, mostly because this term encompasses many subsets such as ransomware, trojans, spyware, viruses, worms, keyloggers, bots, cryptojacking, and any other type of malware attack that leverages software in a malicious way",technical,cybersecurity,
" What is Cybersecurity?
Cybersecurity Engineering involves creating and managing hardware, software, and security policies for the protection of systems, networks, and data.
Cyber engineers incorporate electrical engineering and computer science to understand cyberspace. They use skills developed in digital forensics, security policy and network defense to perform cybersecurity tasks, as well as work on engineering hardware and software. “Cyber engineers design secure systems at the interface of operational technology and information technology,” says Dr. Stan Napper, HCU dean of the College of Science and Engineering and professor of Engineering.

The information website Quora also defines cyber engineering as the fusion of computer science, electrical engineering and mathematics, with the integration of the humanities.

HCU’s Cyber Engineering program provides an engineering-based approach to cybersecurity security education.

A Needed Field
Lecture on what is a cyber security engineer?Cyber engineering is closely linked to preventing and/or resolving cybersecurity issues. Says Dean Napper, “Cyber engineering has been overlooked, or underdeveloped, in addressing cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities among industrial control systems and other Internet of Things networks and devices. Cybersecurity has a software/data/information component and may have, but most likely does not have, a hardware/device component. Cyber engineers apply probability, statistics and cryptographic topics, specialized math and engineering topics. They analyze and design complex devices which are likely to have hardware, software and human components.”

Cybrary reports that day-to-day tasks and activities will vary for cybersecurity engineers, depending on where they work and the types of systems and networks they are responsible for protecting. But some typical daily tasks performed by cybersecurity engineers may include:

Responding to any network or system security breaches or viruses
Ensuring that appropriate security controls are consistently in place to protect the organizations digital files and infrastructure
Planning, implementing, managing, monitoring and upgrading security measures for the protections of systems, networks and data
Various administrative tasks, reporting and communication with other departments
Performing penetration testing and identifying system and network vulnerabilities

" Denial-of-service (DoS) attacks
A Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack is a malicious, targeted attack that floods a network with false requests in order to disrupt business operations.

In a DoS attack, users are unable to perform routine and necessary tasks, such as accessing email, websites, online accounts or other resources that are operated by a compromised computer or network. While most DoS attacks do not result in lost data and are typically resolved without paying a ransom, they cost the organization time, money and other resources in order to restore critical business operations.

The difference between DoS and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks has to do with the origin of the attack. DoS attacks originate from just one system while DDoS attacks are launched from multiple systems. DDoS attacks are faster and harder to block than DOS attacks because multiple systems must be identified and neutralized to halt the attack.

3. Phishing
Phishing is a type of cyberattack that uses email, SMS, phone, social media, and social engineering techniques to entice a victim to share sensitive information — such as passwords or account numbers — or to download a malicious file that will install viruses on their computer or phone.

Common phishing attacks include:

Type	Description
Spear Phishing	Spear-phishing is a type of phishing attack that targets specific individuals or organizations typically through malicious emails. The goal of spear phishing is to steal sensitive information such as login credentials or infect the targets’ device with malware.
Whaling	A whaling attack is a type of social engineering attack specifically targeting senior or C-level executive employees with the purpose of stealing money or information, or gaining access to the person’s computer in order to execute further cyberattacks.
SMiShing	Smishing is the act of sending fraudulent text messages designed to trick individuals into sharing sensitive data such as passwords, usernames and credit card numbers. A smishing attack may involve cybercriminals pretending to be your bank or a shipping service you use.
Vishing	Vishing, a voice phishing attack, is the fraudulent use of phone calls and voice messages pretending to be from a reputable organization to convince individuals to reveal private information such as bank details and passwords.
4. Spoofing
Spoofing is a technique through which a cybercriminal disguises themselves as a known or trusted source. In so doing, the adversary is able to engage with the target and access their systems or devices with the ultimate goal of stealing information, extorting money or installing malware or other harmful software on the device.

Spoofing can take different forms, which include:

Type	Description
Domain Spoofing	Domain spoofing is a form of phishing where an attacker impersonates a known business or person with fake website or email domain to fool people into the trusting them. Typically, the domain appears to be legitimate at first glance, but a closer look will reveal subtle differences.
Email Spoofing	Email spoofing is a type of cyberattack that targets businesses by using emails with forged sender addresses. Because the recipient trusts the alleged sender, they are more likely to open the email and interact with its contents, such as a malicious link or attachment.
ARP Spoofing	Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) spoofing or ARP poisoning is a form of spoofing attack that hackers use to intercept data. A hacker commits an ARP spoofing attack by tricking one device into sending messages to the hacker instead of the intended recipient. This way, the hacker gains access to your device’s communications, including sensitive data.
5. Identity-based attacks
Identity-driven attacks are extremely hard to detect. When a valid user’s credentials have been compromised and an adversary is masquerading as that user, it is often very difficult to differentiate between the user’s typical behavior and that of the hacker using traditional security measures and tools.

Some on the most common identity-based attacks include:

Type	Description
Kerberoasting	Kerberoasting is a post-exploitation attack technique that attempts to crack the password of a service account within the Active Directory (AD) environment. In a Kerberoasting attack, an adversary masquerades as an account user with a service principal name (SPN) and requests a ticket, which contains an encrypted password.
Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack	A man-in-the-middle attack is a type of cyberattack in which an attacker eavesdrops on a conversation between two targets with the goal of collecting personal data, passwords or banking details, and/or to convince the victim to take an action such as changing login credentials, completing a transaction or initiating a transfer of funds.
Pass-the-Hash Attack	Pass the hash (PtH) is a type of attack in which an adversary steals a “hashed” user credential and uses it to create a new user session on the same network. It does not require the attacker to know or crack the password to gain access to the system. Rather, it uses a stored version of the password to initiate a new session.
Golden Ticket Attack	In a golden ticket attack, adversaries attempt to gain unlimited access to an organization’s domain by accessing user data stored in Microsoft Active Directory. The attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the Kerberos identity authentication protocol, allowing them to bypass authentication methods.
Silver Ticket Attack	A silver ticket is a forged authentication ticket often created when an attacker steals an account password. A forged service ticket is encrypted and enables access to resources for the specific service targeted by the silver ticket attack.
Credential Harvesting	In credential harvesting, cybercriminals gather user credentials — such as user IDs, email addresses, passwords, and other login information — en masse to then access systems, gather sensitive data, or sell it in the dark web.
Credential Stuffing	Credential stuffing attacks work on the premise that people often use the same user ID and password across multiple accounts. Therefore, possessing the credentials for one account may be able to grant access to other, unrelated account.
Password Spraying	The basics of a password spraying attack involve a threat actor using a single common password against multiple accounts on the same application. This avoids the account lockouts that typically occur when an attacker uses a brute force attack on a single account by trying many passwords.
Brute Force Attacks	A brute force attack is uses a trial-and-error approach to systematically guess login info, credentials, and encryption keys. The attacker submits combinations of usernames and passwords until they finally guess correctly.
Downgrade Attacks	Downgrade attacks are a cyberattack where adversaries take advantage of a system’s backward compatibility to force it into less secure modes of operation, such as forcing a user to go into a HTTP version of a website instead of HTTPS.
6. Code injection attacks
Code injection attacks consist of an attacker injecting malicious code into a vulnerable computer or network to change its course of action. There are multiple types of code injection attacks:

Type	Description
SQL Injection	A SQL Injection attack leverages system vulnerabilities to inject malicious SQL statements into a data-driven application, which then allows the hacker to extract information from a database. Hackers use SQL Injection techniques to alter, steal or erase application's database data.
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)	Cross Site Scripting (XSS) is a code injection attack in which an adversary inserts malicious code within a legitimate website. The code then launches as an infected script in the user’s web browser, enabling the attacker to steal sensitive information or impersonate the user. Web forums, message boards, blogs and other websites that allow users to post their own content are the most susceptible to XSS attacks.
Malvertising	Malvertising attacks leverage many other techniques, such as SEO poisoning, to carry out the attack. Typically, the attacker begins by breaching a third-party server, which allows the cybercriminal to inject malicious code within a display ad or some element thereof, such as banner ad copy, creative imagery or video content. Once clicked by a website visitor, the corrupted code within the ad will install malware or adware on the user’s computer.
Data Poisoning	Data poisoning is a type of cyberattack in which an adversary intentionally compromises a training dataset used by an Artificial Intelligence or Machine Learning model to manipulate the operation of that model. When dataset is manipulated during the training phase, the adversary can introduce biases, intentionally create erroneous outputs, introduce vulnerabilities, or otherwise influence predictive capabilities of the model.
7. Supply chain attacks
A supply chain attack is a type of cyberattack that targets a trusted third-party vendor who offers services or software vital to the supply chain. Software supply chain attacks inject malicious code into an application in order to infect all users of an app, while hardware supply chain attacks compromise physical components for the same purpose. Software supply chains are particularly vulnerable because modern software is not written from scratch: rather, it involves many off-the-shelf components, such as third-party APIs, open source code and proprietary code from software vendors.

8. Social engineering attacks
Social engineering is a technique where attackers use psychological tactics to manipulate people into taking a desired action. Through the use of powerful motivators like love, money, fear, and status, attackers can gather sensitive information that they can later use to either extort the organization or leverage such information for a competitive advantage.",technical,cybersecurity,
" Many organizations plan cybersecurity based on technical factors without adequately considering their business goals. Likewise, many organizations make business decisions without adequately considering cybersecurity implications.

 

“We want to make sure that cybersecurity and the business are aligned,” Sheehan said. “People have talked about this for years, but we really need to build that bridge right now. We need to make sure that we're aligned in the right direction and supporting the business as it moves forward. Whether it's the primary goal of the business, a supporting goal, or internal functions, there are different IT and security functions that can align there.”

 

“Securing everything” is expensive, slows response time, and creates constant alerts that make it harder to spot real threats. Instead, make sure you set priorities in line with the business goals. In business terms, your cybersecurity spending should focus on reducing the risks and empowering efficient responses that are most important to maintaining secure business operations. This risk management perspective can help you understand how to balance costs. It can also help you set priorities for the data, assets, people, processes and technologies involved.

 

 

 

Data management
 

As organizations acquire new solutions and data, many adapt their cybersecurity processes along the way. This can lead to a disjointed cybersecurity strategy that sets the wrong priorities or even leaves unprotected gaps. Effective and efficient cybersecurity needs to align with your business data priorities. “Do an analysis of what you have, and then you can prioritize data in different categories for each level of data and the metadata that goes with it,” Sheehan said.

 

In a recent Grant Thornton webinar, most attendees indicated they had not integrated a data assessment into their security operations.

 


 

“Everyone’s at different stages, but relatively few have actually done the full data assessment and integration,” Sheehan said. “You need to understand that this can impact your data privacy as well, especially if you're subject to data privacy regulations.”

 

Organizations need to understand where data resides, what restrictions should apply and what the priorities are for the business. This is important not only for security, but also for programmatic efficiency. Sheehan recalled one organization that chose not to do a data assessment because it deemed the assessment would be too expensive at the time. “I watched them spend about 10 times that amount over the next few years, protecting everything instead of putting things into categories and protecting the right information. It’s actually a huge way to save money — to know what you have, know where it is, know where those data points come together.”

 

 

 

Asset management
 

Effective asset management can enable quicker cybersecurity incident analysis and response, while helping to reduce costs.

 

“Asset management, while not a cyber function, is key to cyber success. Not everything that improves your cybersecurity has to come from your cyber dollars,” Sheehan said. Asset management tools provide insight into your number of users, assets and other accounts. “It makes sense to reduce the unused accounts, assets and devices, which can reduce your software licensing costs and your attack surface.”

 

The more assets and accounts you have live, the more targets for a cybersecurity attack. Unused accounts can be especially dangerous since new activity might go unnoticed. It’s also important to know where you have old systems or software. “Fairly often, teams will find a threat and release a fix that works for recent versions, like Windows Server 2019 and newer,” Sheehan said. “But what about Windows 2016 servers? How many of those do you have? Or, how many iPhones have access to your environment that are on Version 16 or lower? What system would you have to figure that out?”

 

Most organizations ultimately need to track a range of various assets and platforms, including various versions, and Sheehan said this diversity can be a good thing. “One answer for asset management is to try to deploy the same device to everybody. But nature usually doesn’t like a monoculture, and bad things can happen when there’s no diversity. If you have only one operating system, and ransomware or other malware infects that, you may not be able to get into your other SaaS-based tools at all. You may not be able to manage it.”

 

Sheehan said that a diversity of roles can help improve your cybersecurity, too. “Having different people looking at cybersecurity from different perspectives, seeing different aspects, is fantastic.”

 

 

 

People management
 

Since everyone plays a role in cybersecurity, it’s important to manage those roles.

 

“Almost everybody in an organization deals with some relatively sensitive information, to one degree or another,” Sheehan said, including:

End users: The majority of employees interact with sensitive information on a daily basis.
Executives: Leaders are at a higher risk for phishing, since they are often considered most likely targets (“MLT”).
Developers/clinicians/sales/HR/Finance/Internal audit: These teams are outside of cybersecurity but have a special duty to protect sensitive information.
IT staff: IT admins have privileged-access accounts that can potentially halt business operations.
Cybersecurity teams: Apart from operations, these teams also include architecture, policy/governance, identity/access management, privacy, and third-party risk.
 

It’s important to understand the full scope of an employee’s access, because with access comes the potential for mistakes. In a recent Grant Thornton webinar, attendees indicated that accidental employee actions are actually their top cybersecurity concern.

 


 

“If you look through annual reports on cybersecurity, accidental employee actions are really key,” Sheehan said. That’s because a lot of cybersecurity really depends on small decisions — the decisions that employees make every day. “The core aspects of cybersecurity hygiene really might have the most pervasive effect on your overall security,” Sheehan said.

 

Basic cybersecurity hygiene can have the most pervasive effect across the organization, so it’s important to monitor that effect. “There are a lot of things that the cybersecurity team needs to monitor, but they don’t manage or own,” Sheehan said. “Where are all of these things? What is the data you’re monitoring? How are you going to get that data into a place where a group of people can look at it, understand it and provide a context-based and risk-based analysis of what's going on?”

 

To better control access to data and information, consider a zero-trust approach that verifies each access request to protect against internal and external threats. Encryption and blockchain technology can enhance data security to help ensure the safety and integrity of data.

 

There are many elements to an effective cybersecurity strategy. To effectively monitor, manage, maintain and champion cybersecurity that efficiently enables your business goals, you need a central authority that drives and even automates the processes behind your cybersecurity strategy.

 
 
 
Processes and automation
 
 
A security operations center (SOC) can consolidate the ongoing management of your cybersecurity strategy. The SOC can provide 24x7 monitoring of processes, overseeing cybersecurity priorities for data, assets and solutions. The SOC can further analyze centralized activity in a security information and event management (SIEM) tool, to assess risks and initiate actions. SOC areas of interest include:

Data priorities: Your SOC should know where the “keys to the kingdom” data resides, along with other data priorities, to coordinate effective and efficient protection.
Shadow IT: New solutions can appear in the organization. “People often say ‘I want to try out an AI product,’ or ‘I want to use another solution instead of the enterprise standard,’” Sheehan said. “Or, they want to use personal accounts to get into an online tool where they upload data that might include intellectual property. They have a reason, but that doesn't mean that it makes sense and is a good business practice for the organization.” Your SOC can also help spot when these solutions, and their associated risks, arise.
Solution design: Your SOC can help inform your organization’s solution architecture and engineering, helping to ensure alignment with the organization’s business goals and risk management.
Event telemetry: As your SOC monitors your SIEM and other tools, it can assess and prioritize the events and alerts, taking action and identifying opportunities to automate actions in the future.
 

A periodic review of your technology stack can be another important element in cybersecurity. This review can help ensure that tools are being used in ways that align with the cybersecurity strategy and adapt to evolving threats. Continuous updates and assessments can help you take advantage of the full potential of your technologies to safeguard against the dynamic nature of cyber threats.

 

“There are basic things that that the SOC should do to be helping the organization, not just a cost center,” Sheehan said. “Security operations should not be the star of Dr. No. When other teams ask the cybersecurity team for something, the first answer should not be ‘No.’ That's an old-school approach that doesn't make sense. That's not a business enabler, and it just doesn't work. That's a failure.”

 

 

 

Process alignment
 

One of the ways that the SOC can help drive business value is by centralizing and coordinating processes.

 

“You need to have everything in the right place, everything coming together so you can see the big picture, have context for what's going on, and make good analyses of what's going on with what is risky and what is not,” Sheehan said. That might sound like an expensive endeavor, but it usually means coordinating existing activities both inside and outside of typical operations:

Solution development: “We reduce risk by designing secure systems. You reduce cost by designing secure systems. You reduce both by considering security up front,” Sheehan said. Solution development and IT architecture and engineering typically approach solutions from the perspective of making sure they’re available, providing service and stable. Cybersecurity priorities are typically confidentiality, integrity and availability. These overlap, but they are not entirely the same, and it’s important to integrate security into the early stages of solution design and development.
Solution procurement: The procurement and finance teams need to be coordinated with IT and cybersecurity, to help ensure that new purchases or contracts are aligned with an efficient cybersecurity strategy and support.
Identity and access management (IAM): Your organization’s IAM might be managed by IT and audited by cybersecurity, or you might have another structure, but you need to centralize and monitor IAM information so that you can efficiently see if there are compromised accounts. You also need to reduce your attack surface by decommissioning accounts or systems when appropriate. “Please also remember, as you're reducing that number of users, to always have a break-glass function,” Sheehan said. “You need a way to get back in, in case other things happen with your IAM system. And your system should alert you if that account ever gets used.”
Governance: The policy and governance teams have a risk management strategy that should be informed by, and coordinated with, cybersecurity needs. Data retention standards, for instance, need to be aligned with the right minimum and maximum timelines that allow for effective and efficient cybersecurity. Policies can also be important to help direct and authorize the organization’s actions. As your employees, contractors and other collaborators gain access to new technologies and solutions, make sure that you have policies in place to address any activities which put your organization at risk, to authorize the appropriate action.
Internal audit: Internal audit should play a central role in assessing your IT risks, including your cybersecurity risks. The internal auditors usually start by evaluating the organization’s policies but, even when policies exist, they need to go farther to ensure that the policies are being followed.
Training: Training can be at the center of driving cybersecurity hygiene, across the organization’s workforce, in an ongoing way. “That human firewall is important — make sure that people have an idea of what to do,” Sheehan said. “You won't stop every click, but you want to make sure they understand the threats and have an awareness.”
Even with an SOC and effective cybersecurity processes in place, a growing number of organizations are also getting cybersecurity insurance. These insurance providers typically require cybersecurity audits, and a framework of cybersecurity standards, that can help enforce compliance across the organization. The standards can help identify issues that the organization might not have been monitoring, and compliance is usually tied to the cost of the insurance. So, better cybersecurity can be directly tied to cost savings.

 

“One key piece is that whoever signs up for that insurance — the CFO or COO office — needs to communicate with the CIO, CISO, IT and cybersecurity teams about who has it, what it covers and the other details,” Sheehan said. “Often, executives tell us that they have it, but others on the executive team don't know about it and have no idea what the coverages are.” It’s also important to note that policies might have preferred providers and might not cover work from other providers at the same level.

 

It can even be important to call your cybersecurity insurance provider in the midst of an attack. “They can often help negotiate with the attackers, especially if it's ransomware,” Sheehan said. “They can help negotiate that down because the insurer's paying it, so it's in their best interest.”

 

Effective process alignment can help you improve security while also saving costs. Plus, when an SOC can look at centralized processes, it can more effectively identify tasks that are standardized, repeatable and time-consuming. These can be excellent candidates for automation.",technical,cybersecurity,
" What is cybersecurity?
Cybersecurity is the practice of using technology, controls, and processes to protect digital networks, devices, and data from unauthorized access by malicious attackers or unintentional activity. It includes ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information using many types of cybersecurity.

Ten types of cybersecurity
Many types of cybersecurity are employed to protect digital systems from malicious and accidental threats. It is helpful to understand the ten most commonly referenced types of cybersecurity.

1. Application security
Application security prevents unauthorized access and use of applications and connected data. Because most vulnerabilities are introduced during the development and publishing stages, application security includes many types of cybersecurity solutions to help identify flaws during the design and development phases that could be exploited and alert teams so they can be fixed.

Despite best efforts, flaws do slip through the cracks. Application security also helps protect against these vulnerabilities.

A subset of application security is web application security. It focuses on protecting web applications, which are frequently targeted by cyber attacks.

2. Cloud security
Cloud security focuses on protecting cloud-based assets and services, including applications, data, and infrastructure. Most cloud security is managed as a shared responsibility between organizations and cloud service providers.

In this shared responsibility model, cloud service providers handle security for the cloud environment, and organizations secure what is in the cloud. Generally, the responsibilities are divided as shown below.

Types of cybersecurity functions managed by cloud service providers are: 	Types of cybersecurity functions managed by organizations are: 
-Availability -Database and storage security  -Edge location security  -Encryption of cloud data at rest, in motion, and in use  -Infrastructure security  -Networking security 	-Application security functions  -Data protection  -Identity and access management  -Network traffic encryption  -Operating system security functions  -Server-side encryption
3. Critical infrastructure security
Special security processes and types of cybersecurity solutions are used to protect the networks, applications, systems, and digital assets depended on by critical infrastructure organizations (e.g., communications, dams, energy, public sector, and transportation). Critical infrastructure has been more vulnerable to cyber attacks that target legacy systems, such as SCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition) systems. While critical infrastructure organizations use many of the same types of cybersecurity as other subcategories, it is often deployed in different ways.

4. Data security
A subset of information security, data security combines many types of cybersecurity solutions to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of digital assets at rest (i.e., while being stored) and in motion (i.e., while being transmitted).

5. Endpoint security
Desktops, laptops, mobile devices, servers, and other endpoints are the most common entry point for cyber attacks. Endpoint security protects these devices and the data they house. It also encompasses other types of cybersecurity that are used to protect networks from cyberattacks that use endpoints as the point of entry.

6. IoT (Internet of Things) security
IoT security seeks to minimize the vulnerabilities that these proliferating devices bring to organizations. It uses different types of cybersecurity to detect and classify them, segment them to limit network exposure, and seek to mitigate threats related to unpatched firmware and other related flaws.

7. Mobile security
Mobile security encompasses types of cybersecurity used to protect mobile devices (e.g., phones, tablets, and laptops) from unauthorized access and becoming an attack vector used to get into and move networks.

8. Network security
Network security includes software and hardware solutions that protect against incidents that result in unauthorized access or service disruption. This includes monitoring and responding to risks that impact network software (e.g., operating systems and protocols) and hardware (e.g., servers, clients, hubs, switches, bridges, peers, and connecting devices).

The majority of cyber attacks start over a network. Network cybersecurity is designed to monitor, detect, and respond to network-focused threats.

9. Operational security
Operational security covers many types of cybersecurity processes and technology used to protect sensitive systems and data by establishing protocols for access and monitoring to detect unusual behavior that could be a sign of malicious activity.

10. Zero trust
The zero trust security model replaces the traditional perimeter-focused approach of building walls around an organization’s critical assets and systems. There are several defining characteristics of the zero trust approach, which leverages many types of cybersecurity.

At its core, zero trust is based on several practices, including:

Continuously verifying users’ identity
Establishing and enforcing the principle of least privilege for access, granting only the access that is explicitly required for a user to perform a job and only for as long as that access is required
Microsegmenting networks
Trusting no users (i.e., internal or external)
Many of the solutions within each of these types of cybersecurity are used across subcategories, such as:

Anti-malware software
Antivirus systems
Backup
Data loss prevention (DLP)
Enterprise mobility management
Encryption
Endpoint detection and response (EDR)
Enterprise mobility management (EMM)
Firewalls
Identity and access management (IAM)
Intrusion detection and prevention system (IDPS)
Mobile application management (MAM)
Multi-factor authentication
Network access control (NAC)
Next-generation firewall (NGFW)
Secure access service edge (SASE)
Secure email gateways (SEG)
Security information and event management (SIEM)
Security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR)
User and entity behavior analytics (UEBA)
Virtual private networks (VPNs)
Web application firewalls (WAFs)",technical,cybersecurity,
" How cybersecurity threats have evolved
Types of cybersecurity threats have changed significantly since 1965, when the first computer vulnerability exploit occurred. The following is a brief timeline of notable incidents.

1965: Software vulnerability
William D. Mathews from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) found a flaw in a Multics Compatible Time-Sharing System (CTSS), the first general-purpose time-sharing operating system. The vulnerability could be used to disclose the contents of the password file. This is widely held to be the first reported vulnerability in a computer system.

1970: Virus
Bob Thomas created the first virus and unleashed the first cyber attack. Meant as a joke, the program moved between computers and displayed the message, “I’m the creeper, catch me if you can.”

In response, his friend, Ray Tomlinson, wrote a program that moved from computer to computer and duplicated itself as it went. The message was changed to “I’m the reaper, catch me if you can.”

While these were intended to be practical jokes, they started what would evolve into the advent of malicious cyberattacks.

1989: Worm
The Morris Worm, created by Robert Morris to determine the size of the internet, ended up being responsible for the first-ever denial-of-service (DoS) attack. With an initial infection, the worm slowed computers, but by infecting the same system multiple times, the worm was able to cause systems to crash.

1989: Trojan
The first ransomware attack was perpetrated at the 1989 World Health Organization’s AIDS conference when Joseph Popp distrusted 20,000 inflected floppy discs. Once booted, the discs encrypted users’ files and demanded payment to unencrypt them.

1990s: Fast-spreading, malicious viruses
Particularly virulent viruses began to emerge in the 1990s, with the I LOVE YOU and Melissa viruses spreading around the world, infecting tens of millions of systems and causing them to crash. These viruses were distributed via email.

Early 2000s: Advanced persistent threats (APTs)
The early 2000s saw the rise of advanced persistent threats (APTs), with the Titan Rain campaign aimed at computer systems in the US and believed to have been initiated by China. Perhaps the most famous ATP is the Stuxnet worm that was used to attack Iran’s SCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition) systems in 2010, which were integral to their nuclear program.

Early 2000s: Ransomware-as-a-service
The first ransomware-as-a-service, Reveton, was made available on the dark web in 2012. This allowed those without specialized technical abilities to rent a ransomware system, including collecting payments.

The 2013 emergency of the CryptoLocker ransomware marked a turning point for this malware. CryptoLocker not only used encryption to lock files, but was distributed using botnets.

2016: Botnets used to attack IoT devices
As the Internet of Things (IoT) exploded, this became a new attack vector. In 2016, the Mirai botnet was used to attack and infect more than 600,000 IoT devices worldwide.

2020: Supply chain attack
In 2020, a vulnerability in one enterprise organization’s network management system software was exploited by a group believed to be working with Russia. More than 18,000 customers were impacted when they deployed a malicious update that came from the compromised organization.

Present
Traditional cyber attack methods continue to be widely used because they remain effective. These are being joined by evolving versions that take advantage of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) to increase their reach and efficacy. Ironically, many of these attack methods take advantage of the technology that cybersecurity solutions use to thwart them.

Gen V attacks
Categorized as Mega attacks, Gen V is the latest generation of cyber threats. Gen V cyberattacks, which emerged in 2017, use large-scale, multi-vector approaches to target IT infrastructure with advanced attack technologies.

These cyber threats are believed to originate with state organizations that leak the technology to public cybercriminals. The hallmark of Gen V cyberattacks is that they attack multiple vectors and are polymorphic, changing as they move around and acting differently on different systems. NotPetya and WannaCry are examples of Gen V cyberattacks.

Supply chain attacks
Supply chain attacks have evolved with other attack vectors, since the same technologies and approaches are usually used. Supply chains have become a target for cybercriminals because these organizations provide an easier point of entry to specific enterprises than attacking those larger companies directly.

Supply chain attack targets can be used to gain access to many organizations connected with the target.

Ransomware
Ransomware has seen a fast and virulent evolution due to its efficacy and profitability. Attacks have escalated in terms of the scope of what is held hostage and the threats.

Ransomware is used for extortion, with threats of disclosing information or destroying vital data if the ransom terms are not met. Ransomware-as-a-service has also made it much more accessible to cybercriminal elements.

Phishing
Phishing attacks persist as a preferred attack vector for cybercriminals, but new approaches are emerging to evade many types of cybersecurity, such as using QR codes to direct users to malware. There is also an increase in multi-stage attacks to bypass multi-factor authentication.

Spear phishing and whale phishing are also on the rise. These approaches target specific individuals with messages developed using in-depth research to increase effectiveness. Phishing attacks are also increasing due to the rise in phishing kits sold on the dark web.

Malware
Malware continues to evolve by augmenting or changing legacy software using the latest technologies. Gen V cyber attacks leverage these newly updated malware packages.

What is a consolidated cybersecurity architecture?
A consolidated security architecture creates a single point of control for managing multiple types of cybersecurity solutions. When there were fairly limited types of cybersecurity products, it was possible to manage point solutions to defend against different threats and use cases. As the number of types of cybersecurity increased, the move to a unified approach was driven by:

A growth of remote workforces that dissolved security perimeters and multiplied threat vectors as users connected from disparate points with varying degrees of protection.
An endpoint explosion that started with desktop and laptop systems and grew to a great sprawl of connected devices, including mobile phones, tablets, and IoT devices.
Increased complexity as new types of cybersecurity solutions were added to the defense mix to address new threats and hybrid environments (i.e., on-premises systems and users along with cloud systems and applications) that were difficult to monitor and manage.
A need for more sophisticated types of cybersecurity to combat more adept cyber attackers with more advanced threats that could not be detected with legacy security tools.
A consolidated cybersecurity architecture was created to solve for these issues by integrating different types of cybersecurity and aggregating them under a centralized, scalable control platform. With this new model, specialized cybersecurity could be leveraged in the fight against threats and risks more cost-effectively and efficiently. A consolidated cybersecurity architecture delivers a number of benefits, including:

Eliminates overlapping functionality that comes with disparate cybersecurity deployments
Expedites the creation of rules and reports
Fills gaps in security coverage due to multiple solutions’ inability to communicate and work together cohesively
Maximizes efficacy of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) to improve detection capabilities and accelerate response times
Provides broad visibility across all cybersecurity functions in the organization
Reduces the expenses associated with purchasing and implementing different types of cybersecurity
Reduces the number of tools and vendors needed to perform different cybersecurity functions
Shifts to an integrated security approach that enhances cybersecurity posture
Simplifies threat monitoring and prevention as well as incident response
Streamlines management and maintenance of the many types of cybersecurity
Unifies cybersecurity solutions to enable protection across all attack surfaces (e.g., networks, devices, and applications)
Many types of cybersecurity are needed to combat cybercrime
Cybercrime, attack surfaces, and attack methods continue to grow and evolve, getting more complex with time. The good news is that there are many types of cybersecurity solutions to combat cybercriminals. Taking time to understand the relevant threats and vulnerabilities helps organizations find the right mix of cybersecurity solutions and the best ways to deploy them.",technical,cybersecurity,
" Take steps to protect your organization
The cyber bad guys spend every waking moment thinking about how to compromise your cybersecurity procedures and controls. The best defense begins with elevating the issue of cyber risk as an enterprise and strategic risk-management issue. If possible, you should also dedicate at least one person full time to lead the information security program, and prioritize that role so that he or she has sufficient authority, status and independence to be effective. Furthermore, you and your team should receive regular updates on your organization’s strategic cyber risk profile and whether adequate measures are dynamically being taken to mitigate the constantly evolving cyber risk.

Finally, the most important defense is to instill a patient safety-focused culture of cybersecurity. This enables health care organizations to leverage their existing culture of patient care to impart a complementary culture of cybersecurity. A culture of cybersecurity, where the staff members view themselves as proactive defenders of patients and their data, will have a tremendous impact in mitigating cyber risk to the organization and to patients.

As senior advisor for cybersecurity and risk for the American Hospital Association, I am available to assist your organization in uncovering strategic cyber risk and vulnerabilities by conducting an in-depth cyber-risk profile, and by providing other cybersecurity advisory services such as risk mitigation strategies; incident response planning; vendor risk management review; and customized education, training and cyber incident exercises for executives and boards. Please contact",technical,cybersecurity,
" The latest data released by CyberSeek (a joint initiative of NICE, a program of the National Institute of Standards and Technology focused on advancing cybersecurity education and workforce development, analytics firm Lightcast, and CompTIA) shows that there are only enough tech professionals to fill 83 percent of the available security jobs, down slightly from the 85 percent reported earlier this year.


This translates into U.S. companies and government agencies needing approximately 265,000 more cybersecurity pros to meet current staffing needs. The site estimates that about 1.25 million people work in cybersecurity.


CyberSeek also noted in its October release that between September 2023 and August 2024, more than 457,000 cyber-related jobs were posted. While cybersecurity job postings were down 22 percent during this time, the security market fared better than the overall tech market, which saw job postings decline by about 28 percent during the same time.


These statistics indicate that private companies and government agencies are more willing to invest in cybersecurity jobs even as high-tech firms and other businesses trim general IT staff.


“The hiring landscape looks promising, with a substantial gap still evident in the demand for cybersecurity professionals. Various hiring trends and metrics are indicating an uptick in recruitment efforts, alongside a surge of new security companies popping up from stealth mode over the last year,” Amir Shaked, vice president of engineering at Oasis Security, recently told Dice. “While there’s definitely progress, we’re still facing a critical shortage of qualified practitioners, which suggests that hiring will continue to grow in the coming year.”


The CyberSeek data also noted that this critical shortage of cybersecurity workers is related to the so-called skills gap, with potential candidates lacking specific knowledge and experience to fill certain positions. Other studies, however, found that recent budget cuts are more likely to blame for organizations not hiring enough talent. 


CyberSeek recommends reskilling and upskilling current staff to take on more cybersecurity duties, and for organizations to seek out talent through non-conventional avenues such as the apprenticeship programs (which have also been championed by the outgoing Biden administration).


Many cybersecurity experts see reskilling and upskilling as effective ways to fill open positions and add more talent to the pipeline. This also provides more opportunities to those who want to explore security careers.


“In the coming year, hiring will likely focus on addressing this gap through reskilling and upskilling,” said Jason Soroko, a senior fellow at security firm Sectigo. “Skills in demand include artificial intelligence integration in cybersecurity, along with traditional roles like incident analysis and cybersecurity engineering, particularly due to evolving technological challenges and  geopolitical tensions.”


Knowing Which Cybersecurity Skills to Focus On
Unsurprisingly, the CyberSeek data shows that more employers are seeking cybersecurity professionals who understand A.I. 


The data noted that job cybersecurity postings that require some A.I. knowledge have increased from 6.3 percent to 7.3 percent. While important, it pales compared to more general tech jobs, which saw A.I. requirements jump from 18.5 percent to over 25 percent within the last year.


While the cybersecurity field is coming to grips with A.I. and its potential—as well as how attackers may deploy these tools for nefarious purposes—experts noted that potential candidates need to demonstrate some knowledge of the technology to have a chance at landing a job.


“The skillset that is most important is adoption of automation technologies,” Soroko told Dice. “This often requires staff to think about how to optimize their productivity, which leaves many to conclude they are working themselves out of a job. That is the opposite of what they should be thinking. Automation will be crucial in all forms of cybersecurity going forward.”


With A.I. technologies now integrated into more platforms, experts noted that organizations need talented and experienced cybersecurity talent who can properly interpret the data these A.I.-infused systems capture.


“A.I. and machine learning continue to reshape the cybersecurity landscape and having knowledge in these areas will be increasingly valuable,” Anne Cutler, cybersecurity evangelist at Keeper Security, told Dice. “While A.I. can significantly enhance threat detection and response capabilities, it’s critically important that organizations complement these tools with human expertise to navigate the complexities of cyber threats effectively.”


While A.I. is receiving the lion’s share of attention nowadays, Cutler noted that successful cybersecurity professionals must ensure that they have other skills, especially fundamentals such as knowledge of networking and how cloud infrastructures work.


“To thrive in this evolving field, cybersecurity professionals should focus on building a strong foundation of technical knowledge and skills. Essential competencies include expertise in programming, network technologies and cloud services, along with a solid understanding of operating systems and data storage,” Cutler added. “Additionally, familiarity with wireless technologies and hardware systems is vital, as understanding how these technologies interconnect is crucial for effective cybersecurity practices.”",technical,cybersecurity,
" An important concept when learning about behavioral analysis in cybersecurity is understanding both how individuals create risk to organizations and how to mitigate those risks. This begins with the understanding that hackers will always seek the easiest possible path into a network, which is often through employees and other individuals.

In research conducted by Micro Trend, 91% of targeted cyberattacks involved spear-phishing emails, or emails that are personalized to the recipient. Compared to generic phishing emails sent to many recipients – which only had an open rate of about 3% – targeted spear-phishing messages had an open rate of 70%.

Emails aren’t the only risk. In an era of BYOD, shadow IT and ineffective security training, IT departments face an uphill battle when it comes to reducing risk. Even if a network is secure, a single mistake by a well-meaning employee can expose it to a breach.

Therefore, it’s important for cybersecurity professionals to study human behavior and find ways to educate and train people to avoid these mistakes. This means making training accessible and relevant – and implementing security controls that are both effective and easy-to-use – without disrupting workflow.

Threat Detection and Defining ""Normal""
One of the biggest issues in cybersecurity is identifying what constitutes a threat. A traditional approach may involve detection and alerts, followed by system lockdowns. This blunt-force approach to security can result in false positives and may miss legitimate threats.

On the other hand, a behavior-based approach to cybersecurity may involve monitoring a network and developing a baseline of what’s considered “normal” behavior, which will, in turn, make it easier to identify anything that’s abnormal.

By using this approach – which may involve machine learning and specialized algorithms – IT departments can gain a better understanding of what’s happening on their networks on a regular basis. Ultimately, by defining what’s typical, strange behaviors and anomalies become easier to detect and the likelihood of false positives decreases.

In an article about behavioral analysis in cybersecurity, Security Roundtable outlined several types of anomalies that can be identified through this analysis:

Applications.
Devices.
Geography.
Networks.
Schedules.
By establishing a baseline of typical behavior, it’s possible to trigger security measures when behavior extends beyond a defined range. For instance, if your business is based in New York and your team normally works from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., a login attempt from an IP address in Los Angeles at 3 a.m. may be a criminal attempting to access the network.

This scenario may also simply be a worker on vacation trying to finish a project while their family sleeps. To account for this possibility, the response may be to ask for additional authentication rather than an immediate lockout. If a user cannot provide the additional credentials, then the system will lock them out, but an authorized user will be able to access the system without any further issues.

Conclusion
Behavioral analysis skills may be among the most in-demand among cybersecurity professionals in the future. As companies look for new solutions, the need for educated and experienced professionals who understand the human aspects of cybersecurity will only increase.

" Feature Article: Leveraging AI to Enhance the Nation’s Cybersecurity
Release Date: October 17, 2024
Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) can potentially provide the homeland unprecedented opportunity to enhance its cybersecurity posture. The Science and Technology Directorate (S&T) is exploring the possibilities of using new advances in this technology to quickly process large amounts of data and deploy models to detect threats, increase resilience and provide more supply chain oversight.

When you hear about AI in the news, it sounds as if the robots of science fiction will be taking over soon. What isn’t as commonly covered is how much potential it has to make things safer from a cybersecurity perspective. The sheer volume of data it can process in a compressed period of time and then, contextualizing that data using ML, have vast implications for those attempting to make the nation more cyber secure.

The Science and Technology Directorate (S&T) is exploring the many ways this technology and its newer applications can support the national security mission, in line with the DHS AI Roadmap and its “Protect AI systems from cybersecurity threats and guard against AI-enabled cyberattacks” workstream. There are cybersecurity problems that are more complex where AI can provide solutions—and potential protections—never imagined, according to Donald Coulter, S&T’s Senior Science Advisor on Cybersecurity.

S&T is working on a number of initiatives that are intended to help inform the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency’s (CISA) AI strategy. For instance, S&T has a project underway to research advanced methods for enabling real-time management of cyber threats to critical infrastructure. Another project is increasing the resilience of software analysis tools by helping to identify and mitigate possible weaknesses in ML-based reverse engineering tools, as part of an overarching strategy to assess and mitigate risks of adversarial attacks on AI-based systems. This effort involves identifying whether certain ML algorithms may be susceptible to subversion by sophisticated adversaries, which could make it difficult to understand and mitigate attacks on our models. There is also work being done to help CISA launch a testbed that can provide a secure, connected multi-cloud environment to support AI development and testing. Since AI systems are software systems, ensuring that they are designed and deployed securely is an extension of CISA’s cybersecurity mission.

“CISA understands that AI is the future and intends to move further in that direction,” said S&T Program Manager Benson Macon. “We can provide them with the contract vehicle to support very specific R&D activities. We get them the experts. Contract support is critical at this time, especially when it comes to AI. There is a shortage within this field of expertise. We must bring in the experts that are more specialized and have the knowledge depth, coupled with the technology experience gained in the IT industry.”

Future-Looking AI Exploration
A large part of S&T’s current work on AI cybersecurity applications is around conducting the necessary research to help chart a future course, looking forward on how AI will evolve and may be applied. S&T funded a series of Emerging Technology and Risk Analysis reports on emerging technologies, and one—co-authored by former S&T Acting Under Secretary Dan Gerstein—looked specifically at risks and scenarios relating to AI use affecting critical infrastructure. While assessing that both challenges and opportunities exist, researchers pointed to the arrival of commercially-available generative AI in March 2023 as an interesting case study for how AI technologies—in this case, large-language models—are likely to mature and be integrated into society. This disruptive generative AI “bot” was capable of analyzing large quantities of data and generating content, performing a human-like function never before seen. According to the report, the initial rollout illustrated a cycle—development, deployment, identification of shortcomings and other areas of potential use and rapid updating of AI systems—that will likely be a feature of future AI evolutions.

S&T also partnered with the National Science Foundation (NSF) on the launch of the AI Institute for Agent-Based Cyber Threat Intelligence and Operation (ACTION). Only a year old, S&T hopes that the R&D developed will ultimately inform S&T’s AI Roadmap and help push its development programs forward into the future. “We will take the knowledge learned and preliminary technologies developed to inform our approach to operationalizing AI for cybersecurity,” Coulter said.

The ACTION Institute, a federally funded university consortium, seeks to change the way mission-critical systems are protected against sophisticated, ever-changing security threats. The ultimate goal is to design AI-based intelligent agents for security operations experts to use that will apply complex knowledge representation and logic reasoning, learning to identify flaws, detect attacks, perform attribution and respond to breaches in a timely and scalable fashion.

“We are using AI to increase the effectiveness of our cybersecurity mechanisms and researching ways we can use distributed learning and automated intelligent agents to monitor the network for anomalies. Can we apply this? How do we make our detection and mitigation techniques automated and identify indicators of compromise?” Coulter said.

Human Teaming Is the Key
The robots won’t be taking over at S&T anytime soon, as it is committed to applying a human-machine teaming approach, especially when it comes to cybersecurity, with the understanding that there are unique advantages to keeping humans in the loop that lends to greater controls and oversight of quality. The Center for Accelerating Operational Efficiency (CAOE), one of its many DHS Centers of Excellence (COE), has a project in progress on Combining Human Intelligence with Artificial Intelligence for a Usable, Adaptable [Software Bill of Materials], more commonly known as CHIAUS. Also focused on software resilience, the objective of this project is to integrate human-centered interactions with Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) data to empower developers and consumers with actionable, understandable risk information and foster greater trust in automated decision-making systems. This increased confidence will come from having more detailed information on each of the software components and chain of custody as well as human factors that could ultimately influence results.

It is S&T’s belief that human-machine teaming will ultimately enhance and increase effectiveness of cybersecurity, Coulter said, and this is undergirding S&T’s approach. While the value of human-in-the-loop is generally recognized as a risk-mitigating feature, S&T is mapping out future research to dig deeper into ways to extract maximum value from AI with minimum risks associated with human error. This future research will seek to identify the most effective human-machine teaming models for homeland security application, determine ways to increase effectiveness of teams individually and at scale and increase trust in both the AI model and the human’s competence as they apply to cybersecurity use cases.

ACTION will look at different components of AI and think through how to build them and how to shape the human interaction with an intelligent agent that is specifically focused on cybersecurity. “How do they interact with each other? How do we pull in thoughts from game theory, social behavioral analysis,” Coulter asked. “The outcome will be that we as an organization will be able to use this tech autonomously to respond to an incident and mitigate it, leading to improved resilience. AI will be used as a tool to create more secure components as part of the design and analyze systems while in operation to identify where potential weak points might be.”",technical,cybersecurity,
" Studying Cybersecurity or Information Technology (IT)
Nowadays, it seems that stories about cybersecurity breaches are always in the news. Malware, phishing and distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks are constant threats in this digital age. And because such cyber threats continue to grow, organizations are forced to try to stay ahead of the hackers using innovative cybersecurity measures.

If you’re interested in cybersecurity, an information technology or computer science cybersecurity degree concentration could provide an opportunity for you to study skills related to this field.

What Is Cybersecurity?
Organizations tend to have their own definitions of cybersecurity:

The Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) defines cybersecurity as the art of protecting networks, devices and data from unauthorized access or criminal use and the practice of ensuring confidentiality, integrity and availability of information.1
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) defines cybersecurity as the process of protecting information by preventing, detecting and responding to attacks.2
Cisco defines cybersecurity as practice of protecting systems, networks and programs from digital attacks. It involves a multi-layered approach of people, processes and technology.3
But despite the different wording, these definitions essentially mean the same thing: cybersecurity involves the protection of electronic data and devices from internet threats. It is focused on making sure that wide area networks (WAN), local area networks (LAN) and other digital communication networks are secure.

Information Security vs. Cybersecurity
While cybersecurity encompasses various measures and approaches taken to protect data and devices from cyberattacks, information security, or InfoSec, refers specifically to the processes and tools designed to protect sensitive data.4 Information security is commonly thought of as a subset of cybersecurity. If you were to visually illustrate information security vs. cybersecurity, information security would appear as a smaller circle within the larger circle of cybersecurity.

What Is IT Security?
IT security refers to securing electronic data from unauthorized users or hackers through computer network security measures. IT security can be thought of as encompassing three different categories:5

college made convenient | learn more CTU
Physical Security (protecting people and infrastructure by securing buildings, server rooms and wiring closets, for example)

Information Security (InfoSec)

Cybersecurity

IT security can also be further broken down into additional security categories:6

Network security

Internet security

Endpoint security

Cloud security

Application security

Why Is IT Security Important?
Although IT security is important in all types of organizations and industries, the need for increased protection against cyber threats has become particularly important in the financial and healthcare sectors. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which applies to the handling and storage of certain types of electronic health data, and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX), which aims to protect shareholders from accounting fraud, are two examples of laws passed by Congress that mandate various data security measures. It is the job of the information technology department to ensure that appropriate IT security measures are taken to comply with such laws.

What Is Information Technology?
Information technology refers to the art and applied sciences that deal with data and information. It also refers to both the hardware and software components involved in electronic data collection, transmission and storage, e.g., computers, operating systems and communications hardware and software.7

IT professionals are responsible for ensuring that effective IT security measures are in place and that an organization’s data and information is safe and secure. Most computer and information technology-related occupations require that candidates possess at least a bachelor’s degree in a computer-related field.8 Information security analysts, for example, usually have completed a bachelor’s in computer and information technology or a related field.9 And computer and information systems managers usually have earned a bachelor’s degree in computer or information science, plus related work experience.10 However, some employers in both fields may require a Master of Business Administration (MBA) on top of a bachelor’s degree in addition to work experience in a related occupation.",technical,cybersecurity,
" When you think of cybersecurity, you probably think about technology. Technical and data-driven solutions are foundations of cybersecurity, but the human element cannot be overlooked.

Not only is human behavior one of the biggest risks to a secure network, but understanding typical behavior is vital to identifying anomalies and preventing cyberattacks. While understanding the technical ins-and-outs of network security is important to a successful career, expertise in behavioral analysis is increasingly in-demand and becoming an aspect of cybersecurity education programs.

In this article, we explore some of the human aspects of cybersecurity.

" The NAO has evaluated whether government is keeping pace with the rapidly evolving cyber threat it faces from hostile actors. It identified that the government’s new cyber assurance scheme, GovAssure, which independently assessed 58 critical departmental IT systems by August 2024, found significant gaps in cyber resilience with multiple fundamental system controls at low levels of maturity across departments.

At least 228 ‘legacy’ IT systems were in use by departments as of March 2024, and the government does not know how vulnerable these systems are to a cyberattack.

In June 2024, a cyberattack on a supplier of pathology services to the NHS in south-east London led to two NHS foundation trusts postponing 10,152 acute outpatient appointments and 1,710 elective procedures. The British Library, which experienced a cyberattack in October 2023, has already spent £600,000 rebuilding its services and expects to spend many times more as it continues its recovery work.

Cyber skills gap, financial pressure, lack of coordination all affecting cyber resilience
The previous government published a strategy for improving government organisations’ cyber security in January 2022. This included a target for key government organisations to be “significantly hardened to cyberattack by 2025”. But government has not improved its cyber resilience fast enough to meet this aim, said the NAO.

One reason for this is shortages of cyber skills within government. In 2023-24, one in three cybersecurity roles in government were vacant or filled by temporary staff (contingent labour); more than 50 percent of cyber roles in several departments were vacant; and 70 percent of specialist security architects in post were temporary staff.

Departments reported that the salaries they can pay, and civil service recruitment processes are barriers to hiring and keeping people with cyber skills.

Other concerns include a lack of coordination within government jeopardising effective cyber defence. The respective roles of departments and organisations at the centre, such as the NCSC, are insufficiently understood. Departmental leaders have not consistently recognised the relevance of cyber risk to their strategic goals, said the NAO.

Financial pressures have also meant that some departments have significantly reduced the scope of their work to build cyber resilience, which could increase the severity of an attack when it happens. In March 2024, departments did not have fully funded plans to remediate around half of government’s legacy IT assets (53 percent, or 120 out of 228), leaving these systems increasingly vulnerable to cyberattack. Under-investment in technology and cyber was a key factor in the British Library cyber incident.

Recommendations to government
The NAO is urging the government to act now to build its cyber capabilities and defences. It recommends government, within the next six months:

Develops, shares and starts using a cross-government implementation plan for the Government Cyber Security Strategy.
Sets out how the whole of government needs to operate differently, and what is needed for this transformation to be effective, so that it can achieve its goals for government cyber security and resilience.
Within the next year:

Make and enact plans to fill cyber skills gaps in workforces.
“The risk of cyberattack is severe, and attacks on key public services are likely to happen regularly, yet government’s work to address this has been slow,” said Gareth Davies, head of the NAO.

“To avoid serious incidents, build resilience and protect the value for money of its operations, government must catch up with the acute cyber threat it faces.

“The government will continue to find it difficult to catch up until it successfully addresses the longstanding shortage of cyber skills; strengthens accountability for cyber risk; and better manages the risks posed by legacy IT.”",technical,cybersecurity,
" Singapore’s government and industry sectors are bolstering defenses against cyberattacks, with the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) and other agencies deepening collaboration with local and foreign partners to protect critical digital infrastructure.

In July 2018, the personal data of 1.5 million individuals, including the then prime minister, was compromised in an attack on the country’s largest group of health care institutions, while a February 2021 attack on leading telecom operator Singtel compromised the data of 129,000 people.

But when Singtel was targeted again in June 2024 in what investigators believe was part of a global campaign by a People’s Republic of China state-sponsored hacking group known as Volt Typhoon, the attack was repelled before any data loss or disruption of service occurred.

The successful response followed a number of key improvements to Singapore’s cyber defense capabilities, notably the 2022 establishment of the Digital and Intelligence Service (DIS) as the SAF’s fourth branch.

The DIS’s focus areas include safeguarding the SAF’s digital infrastructure from cyberattack; intelligence gathering and analysis; digital warfare and information operations; securing command-and-control systems; and ensuring operational resilience in the face of sophisticated cyber threats.

The DIS works with the Cyber Security Agency (CSA), which is managed by the Ministry of Digital Development and Information, to provide centralized oversight of national cybersecurity functions. The DIS and CSA signed a joint operations agreement in November 2022. In November 2024, they organized the third Critical Infrastructure Defence Exercise (CIDeX).

CIDeX drew more than 200 participants from nearly 30 organizations and included simulated attacks against Singapore’s cellular, gas and airport systems. It also focused on artificial intelligence (AI), including threats that could jeopardize AI-powered systems.

CIDeX hones cyber defenders’ skills and demonstrates “our close cooperation with CSA and critical infrastructure organisations across the various sectors,” Brig. Gen. Edward Chen, the SAF’s chief of cyber defense, said in a news release.

The DIS also participated in defense exercise Super Garuda Shield in Indonesia in September 2024, conducting expert exchanges on cyber-defense techniques with international counterparts.

Meanwhile, the ninth Singapore International Cyber Week in October 2024 highlighted the importance of trust and security amid geopolitical tensions, supply chain risks and pressure on democratic systems. It also fostered international collaboration on policy, and technical and diplomatic cybersecurity issues. About 12,000 delegates from over 80 countries attended, with key events including an Association of Southeast Asian Nations ministerial conference on cybersecurity, and panel discussions on topics such as technology regulation and election security.

In January 2025, the DIS and United States-based cybersecurity firm Dragos announced an agreement on enhancing cybersecurity capabilities, collaborating on strategic planning and training, and sharing information on cyber threats. “The DIS continues to expand and build on its partnership with key partners across various sectors, including the tech industry, to further cyber collaboration,” Chen said in a news release.

In October 2024, Chen visited the United Kingdom to attend the International Institute for Strategic Studies’ Cyber Power Workshop and for talks with defense and cybersecurity officials, and industry representatives.",technical,cybersecurity,
" Abstract
Cybercrime is estimated to have cost the global economy just under USD 1 trillion in 2020, indicating an increase of more than 50% since 2018. With the average cyber insurance claim rising from USD 145,000 in 2019 to USD 359,000 in 2020, there is a growing necessity for better cyber information sources, standardised databases, mandatory reporting and public awareness. This research analyses the extant academic and industry literature on cybersecurity and cyber risk management with a particular focus on data availability. From a preliminary search resulting in 5219 cyber peer-reviewed studies, the application of the systematic methodology resulted in 79 unique datasets. We posit that the lack of available data on cyber risk poses a serious problem for stakeholders seeking to tackle this issue. In particular, we identify a lacuna in open databases that undermine collective endeavours to better manage this set of risks. The resulting data evaluation and categorisation will support cybersecurity researchers and the insurance industry in their efforts to comprehend, metricise and manage cyber risks.

Introduction
Globalisation, digitalisation and smart technologies have escalated the propensity and severity of cybercrime. Whilst it is an emerging field of research and industry, the importance of robust cybersecurity defence systems has been highlighted at the corporate, national and supranational levels. The impacts of inadequate cybersecurity are estimated to have cost the global economy USD 945 billion in 2020 (Maleks Smith et al. 2020). Cyber vulnerabilities pose significant corporate risks, including business interruption, breach of privacy and financial losses (Sheehan et al. 2019). Despite the increasing relevance for the international economy, the availability of data on cyber risks remains limited. The reasons for this are many. Firstly, it is an emerging and evolving risk; therefore, historical data sources are limited (Biener et al. 2015). It could also be due to the fact that, in general, institutions that have been hacked do not publish the incidents (Eling and Schnell 2016). The lack of data poses challenges for many areas, such as research, risk management and cybersecurity (Falco et al. 2019). The importance of this topic is demonstrated by the announcement of the European Council in April 2021 that a centre of excellence for cybersecurity will be established to pool investments in research, technology and industrial development. The goal of this centre is to increase the security of the internet and other critical network and information systems (European Council 2021).

This research takes a risk management perspective, focusing on cyber risk and considering the role of cybersecurity and cyber insurance in risk mitigation and risk transfer. The study reviews the existing literature and open data sources related to cybersecurity and cyber risk. This is the first systematic review of data availability in the general context of cyber risk and cybersecurity. By identifying and critically analysing the available datasets, this paper supports the research community by aggregating, summarising and categorising all available open datasets. In addition, further information on datasets is attached to provide deeper insights and support stakeholders engaged in cyber risk control and cybersecurity. Finally, this research paper highlights the need for open access to cyber-specific data, without price or permission barriers.

The identified open data can support cyber insurers in their efforts on sustainable product development. To date, traditional risk assessment methods have been untenable for insurance companies due to the absence of historical claims data (Sheehan et al. 2021). These high levels of uncertainty mean that cyber insurers are more inclined to overprice cyber risk cover (Kshetri 2018). Combining external data with insurance portfolio data therefore seems to be essential to improve the evaluation of the risk and thus lead to risk-adjusted pricing (Bessy-Roland et al. 2021). This argument is also supported by the fact that some re/insurers reported that they are working to improve their cyber pricing models (e.g. by creating or purchasing databases from external providers) (EIOPA 2018). Figure 1 provides an overview of pricing tools and factors considered in the estimation of cyber insurance based on the findings of EIOPA (2018) and the research of Romanosky et al. (2019). The term cyber risk refers to all cyber risks and their potential impact.

Besides the advantage of risk-adjusted pricing, the availability of open datasets helps companies benchmark their internal cyber posture and cybersecurity measures. The research can also help to improve risk awareness and corporate behaviour. Many companies still underestimate their cyber risk (Leong and Chen 2020). For policymakers, this research offers starting points for a comprehensive recording of cyber risks. Although in many countries, companies are obliged to report data breaches to the respective supervisory authority, this information is usually not accessible to the research community. Furthermore, the economic impact of these breaches is usually unclear.

As well as the cyber risk management community, this research also supports cybersecurity stakeholders. Researchers are provided with an up-to-date, peer-reviewed literature of available datasets showing where these datasets have been used. For example, this includes datasets that have been used to evaluate the effectiveness of countermeasures in simulated cyberattacks or to test intrusion detection systems. This reduces a time-consuming search for suitable datasets and ensures a comprehensive review of those available. Through the dataset descriptions, researchers and industry stakeholders can compare and select the most suitable datasets for their purposes. In addition, it is possible to combine the datasets from one source in the context of cybersecurity or cyber risk. This supports efficient and timely progress in cyber risk research and is beneficial given the dynamic nature of cyber risks.

Cyber risks are defined as “operational risks to information and technology assets that have consequences affecting the confidentiality, availability, and/or integrity of information or information systems” (Cebula et al. 2014). Prominent cyber risk events include data breaches and cyberattacks (Agrafiotis et al. 2018). The increasing exposure and potential impact of cyber risk have been highlighted in recent industry reports (e.g. Allianz 2021; World Economic Forum 2020). Cyberattacks on critical infrastructures are ranked 5th in the World Economic Forum's Global Risk Report. Ransomware, malware and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) are examples of the evolving modes of a cyberattack. One example is the ransomware attack on the Colonial Pipeline, which shut down the 5500 mile pipeline system that delivers 2.5 million barrels of fuel per day and critical liquid fuel infrastructure from oil refineries to states along the U.S. East Coast (Brower and McCormick 2021). These and other cyber incidents have led the U.S. to strengthen its cybersecurity and introduce, among other things, a public body to analyse major cyber incidents and make recommendations to prevent a recurrence (Murphey 2021a). Another example of the scope of cyberattacks is the ransomware NotPetya in 2017. The damage amounted to USD 10 billion, as the ransomware exploited a vulnerability in the windows system, allowing it to spread independently worldwide in the network (GAO 2021). In the same year, the ransomware WannaCry was launched by cybercriminals. The cyberattack on Windows software took user data hostage in exchange for Bitcoin cryptocurrency (Smart 2018). The victims included the National Health Service in Great Britain. As a result, ambulances were redirected to other hospitals because of information technology (IT) systems failing, leaving people in need of urgent assistance waiting. It has been estimated that 19,000 cancelled treatment appointments resulted from losses of GBP 92 million (Field 2018). Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, ransomware attacks increased significantly, as working from home arrangements increased vulnerability (Murphey 2021b).

Besides cyberattacks, data breaches can also cause high costs. Under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), companies are obliged to protect personal data and safeguard the data protection rights of all individuals in the EU area. The GDPR allows data protection authorities in each country to impose sanctions and fines on organisations they find in breach. “For data breaches, the maximum fine can be €20 million or 4% of global turnover, whichever is higher” (GDPR.EU 2021). Data breaches often involve a large amount of sensitive data that has been accessed, unauthorised, by external parties, and are therefore considered important for information security due to their far-reaching impact (Goode et al. 2017). A data breach is defined as a “security incident in which sensitive, protected, or confidential data are copied, transmitted, viewed, stolen, or used by an unauthorized individual” (Freeha et al. 2021). Depending on the amount of data, the extent of the damage caused by a data breach can be significant, with the average cost being USD 392 millionFootnote1 (IBM Security 2020).

This research paper reviews the existing literature and open data sources related to cybersecurity and cyber risk, focusing on the datasets used to improve academic understanding and advance the current state-of-the-art in cybersecurity. Furthermore, important information about the available datasets is presented (e.g. use cases), and a plea is made for open data and the standardisation of cyber risk data for academic comparability and replication. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. The next section describes the related work regarding cybersecurity and cyber risks. The third section outlines the review method used in this work and the process. The fourth section details the results of the identified literature. Further discussion is presented in the penultimate section and the final section concludes.

Related work
Due to the significance of cyber risks, several literature reviews have been conducted in this field. Eling (2020) reviewed the existing academic literature on the topic of cyber risk and cyber insurance from an economic perspective. A total of 217 papers with the term ‘cyber risk’ were identified and classified in different categories. As a result, open research questions are identified, showing that research on cyber risks is still in its infancy because of their dynamic and emerging nature. Furthermore, the author highlights that particular focus should be placed on the exchange of information between public and private actors. An improved information flow could help to measure the risk more accurately and thus make cyber risks more insurable and help risk managers to determine the right level of cyber risk for their company. In the context of cyber insurance data, Romanosky et al. (2019) analysed the underwriting process for cyber insurance and revealed how cyber insurers understand and assess cyber risks. For this research, they examined 235 American cyber insurance policies that were publicly available and looked at three components (coverage, application questionnaires and pricing). The authors state in their findings that many of the insurers used very simple, flat-rate pricing (based on a single calculation of expected loss), while others used more parameters such as the asset value of the company (or company revenue) or standard insurance metrics (e.g. deductible, limits), and the industry in the calculation. This is in keeping with Eling (2020), who states that an increased amount of data could help to make cyber risk more accurately measured and thus more insurable. Similar research on cyber insurance and data was conducted by Nurse et al. (2020). The authors examined cyber insurance practitioners' perceptions and the challenges they face in collecting and using data. In addition, gaps were identified during the research where further data is needed. The authors concluded that cyber insurance is still in its infancy, and there are still several unanswered questions (for example, cyber valuation, risk calculation and recovery). They also pointed out that a better understanding of data collection and use in cyber insurance would be invaluable for future research and practice. Bessy-Roland et al. (2021) come to a similar conclusion. They proposed a multivariate Hawkes framework to model and predict the frequency of cyberattacks. They used a public dataset with characteristics of data breaches affecting the U.S. industry. In the conclusion, the authors make the argument that an insurer has a better knowledge of cyber losses, but that it is based on a small dataset and therefore combination with external data sources seems essential to improve the assessment of cyber risks.

Several systematic reviews have been published in the area of cybersecurity (Kruse et al. 2017; Lee et al. 2020; Loukas et al. 2013; Ulven and Wangen 2021). In these papers, the authors concentrated on a specific area or sector in the context of cybersecurity. This paper adds to this extant literature by focusing on data availability and its importance to risk management and insurance stakeholders. With a priority on healthcare and cybersecurity, Kruse et al. (2017) conducted a systematic literature review. The authors identified 472 articles with the keywords ‘cybersecurity and healthcare’ or ‘ransomware’ in the databases Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature, PubMed and Proquest. Articles were eligible for this review if they satisfied three criteria: (1) they were published between 2006 and 2016, (2) the full-text version of the article was available, and (3) the publication is a peer-reviewed or scholarly journal. The authors found that technological development and federal policies (in the U.S.) are the main factors exposing the health sector to cyber risks. Loukas et al. (2013) conducted a review with a focus on cyber risks and cybersecurity in emergency management. The authors provided an overview of cyber risks in communication, sensor, information management and vehicle technologies used in emergency management and showed areas for which there is still no solution in the literature. Similarly, Ulven and Wangen (2021) reviewed the literature on cybersecurity risks in higher education institutions. For the literature review, the authors used the keywords ‘cyber’, ‘information threats’ or ‘vulnerability’ in connection with the terms ‘higher education, ‘university’ or ‘academia’. A similar literature review with a focus on Internet of Things (IoT) cybersecurity was conducted by Lee et al. (2020). The review revealed that qualitative approaches focus on high-level frameworks, and quantitative approaches to cybersecurity risk management focus on risk assessment and quantification of cyberattacks and impacts. In addition, the findings presented a four-step IoT cyber risk management framework that identifies, quantifies and prioritises cyber risks.

Datasets are an essential part of cybersecurity research, underlined by the following works. Ilhan Firat et al. (2021) examined various cybersecurity datasets in detail. The study was motivated by the fact that with the proliferation of the internet and smart technologies, the mode of cyberattacks is also evolving. However, in order to prevent such attacks, they must first be detected; the dissemination and further development of cybersecurity datasets is therefore critical. In their work, the authors observed studies of datasets used in intrusion detection systems. Khraisat et al. (2019) also identified a need for new datasets in the context of cybersecurity. The researchers presented a taxonomy of current intrusion detection systems, a comprehensive review of notable recent work, and an overview of the datasets commonly used for assessment purposes. In their conclusion, the authors noted that new datasets are needed because most machine-learning techniques are trained and evaluated on the knowledge of old datasets. These datasets do not contain new and comprehensive information and are partly derived from datasets from 1999. The authors noted that the core of this issue is the availability of new public datasets as well as their quality. The availability of data, how it is used, created and shared was also investigated by Zheng et al. (2018). The researchers analysed 965 cybersecurity research papers published between 2012 and 2016. They created a taxonomy of the types of data that are created and shared and then analysed the data collected via datasets. The researchers concluded that while datasets are recognised as valuable for cybersecurity research, the proportion of publicly available datasets is limited.

The main contributions of this review and what differentiates it from previous studies can be summarised as follows. First, as far as we can tell, it is the first work to summarise all available datasets on cyber risk and cybersecurity in the context of a systematic review and present them to the scientific community and cyber insurance and cybersecurity stakeholders. Second, we investigated, analysed, and made available the datasets to support efficient and timely progress in cyber risk research. And third, we enable comparability of datasets so that the appropriate dataset can be selected depending on the research area.",technical,cybersecurity,
" Methodology
Process and eligibility criteria
The structure of this systematic review is inspired by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) framework (Page et al. 2021), and the search was conducted from 3 to 10 May 2021. Due to the continuous development of cyber risks and their countermeasures, only articles published in the last 10 years were considered. In addition, only articles published in peer-reviewed journals written in English were included. As a final criterion, only articles that make use of one or more cybersecurity or cyber risk datasets met the inclusion criteria. Specifically, these studies presented new or existing datasets, used them for methods, or used them to verify new results, as well as analysed them in an economic context and pointed out their effects. The criterion was fulfilled if it was clearly stated in the abstract that one or more datasets were used. A detailed explanation of this selection criterion can be found in the ‘Study selection’ section.

Information sources
In order to cover a complete spectrum of literature, various databases were queried to collect relevant literature on the topic of cybersecurity and cyber risks. Due to the spread of related articles across multiple databases, the literature search was limited to the following four databases for simplicity: IEEE Xplore, Scopus, SpringerLink and Web of Science. This is similar to other literature reviews addressing cyber risks or cybersecurity, including Sardi et al. (2021), Franke and Brynielsson (2014), Lagerström (2019), Eling and Schnell (2016) and Eling (2020). In this paper, all databases used in the aforementioned works were considered. However, only two studies also used all the databases listed. The IEEE Xplore database contains electrical engineering, computer science, and electronics work from over 200 journals and three million conference papers (IEEE 2021). Scopus includes 23,400 peer-reviewed journals from more than 5000 international publishers in the areas of science, engineering, medicine, social sciences and humanities (Scopus 2021). SpringerLink contains 3742 journals and indexes over 10 million scientific documents (SpringerLink 2021). Finally, Web of Science indexes over 9200 journals in different scientific disciplines (Science 2021).

Search
A search string was created and applied to all databases. To make the search efficient and reproducible, the following search string with Boolean operator was used in all databases: cybersecurity OR cyber risk AND dataset OR database. To ensure uniformity of the search across all databases, some adjustments had to be made for the respective search engines. In Scopus, for example, the Advanced Search was used, and the field code ‘Title-ABS-KEY’ was integrated into the search string. For IEEE Xplore, the search was carried out with the Search String in the Command Search and ‘All Metadata’. In the Web of Science database, the Advanced Search was used. The special feature of this search was that it had to be carried out in individual steps. The first search was carried out with the terms cybersecurity OR cyber risk with the field tag Topic (T.S. =) and the second search with dataset OR database. Subsequently, these searches were combined, which then delivered the searched articles for review. For SpringerLink, the search string was used in the Advanced Search under the category ‘Find the resources with all of the words’. After conducting this search string, 5219 studies could be found. According to the eligibility criteria (period, language and only scientific journals), 1581 studies were identified in the databases:

IEEE: 364

Scopus: 135

Springer Link: 548

Web of Science: 534

An overview of the process is given in Fig. 2. Combined with the results from the four databases, 854 articles without duplicates were identified.

Study selection
In the final step of the selection process, the articles were screened for relevance. Due to a large number of results, the abstracts were analysed in the first step of the process. The aim was to determine whether the article was relevant for the systematic review. An article fulfilled the criterion if it was recognisable in the abstract that it had made a contribution to datasets or databases with regard to cyber risks or cybersecurity. Specifically, the criterion was considered to be met if the abstract used datasets that address the causes or impacts of cyber risks, and measures in the area of cybersecurity. In this process, the number of articles was reduced to 288. The articles were then read in their entirety, and an expert panel of six people decided whether they should be used. This led to a final number of 255 articles. The years in which the articles were published and the exact number can be seen in Fig. 3.

Data collection process and synthesis of the results
For the data collection process, various data were extracted from the studies, including the names of the respective creators, the name of the dataset or database and the corresponding reference. It was also determined where the data came from. In the context of accessibility, it was determined whether access is free, controlled, available for purchase or not available. It was also determined when the datasets were created and the time period referenced. The application type and domain characteristics of the datasets were identified.

Results
This section analyses the results of the systematic literature review. The previously identified studies are divided into three categories: datasets on the causes of cyber risks, datasets on the effects of cyber risks and datasets on cybersecurity. The classification is based on the intended use of the studies. This system of classification makes it easier for stakeholders to find the appropriate datasets. The categories are evaluated individually. Although complete information is available for a large proportion of datasets, this is not true for all of them. Accordingly, the abbreviation N/A has been inserted in the respective characters to indicate that this information could not be determined by the time of submission. The term ‘use cases in the literature’ in the following and supplementary tables refers to the application areas in which the corresponding datasets were used in the literature. The areas listed there refer to the topic area on which the researchers conducted their research. Since some datasets were used interdisciplinarily, the listed use cases in the literature are correspondingly longer. Before discussing each category in the next sections, Fig. 4 provides an overview of the number of datasets found and their year of creation. Figure 5 then shows the relationship between studies and datasets in the period under consideration. Figure 6 shows the distribution of studies, their use of datasets and their creation date. The number of datasets used is higher than the number of studies because the studies often used several datasets (Table 1).

Most of the datasets are generated in the U.S. (up to 58.2%). Canada and Australia rank next, with 11.3% and 5% of all the reviewed datasets, respectively.

Additionally, to create value for the datasets for the cyber insurance industry, an assessment of the applicability of each dataset has been provided for cyber insurers. This ‘Use Case Assessment’ includes the use of the data in the context of different analyses, calculation of cyber insurance premiums, and use of the information for the design of cyber insurance contracts or for additional customer services. To reasonably account for the transition of direct hyperlinks in the future, references were directed to the main websites for longevity (nearest resource point). In addition, the links to the main pages contain further information on the datasets and different versions related to the operating systems. The references were chosen in such a way that practitioners get the best overview of the respective datasets.

Case datasets
This section presents selected articles that use the datasets to analyse the causes of cyber risks. The datasets help identify emerging trends and allow pattern discovery in cyber risks. This information gives cybersecurity experts and cyber insurers the data to make better predictions and take appropriate action. For example, if certain vulnerabilities are not adequately protected, cyber insurers will demand a risk surcharge leading to an improvement in the risk-adjusted premium. Due to the capricious nature of cyber risks, existing data must be supplemented with new data sources (for example, new events, new methods or security vulnerabilities) to determine prevailing cyber exposure. The datasets of cyber risk causes could be combined with existing portfolio data from cyber insurers and integrated into existing pricing tools and factors to improve the valuation of cyber risks.

A portion of these datasets consists of several taxonomies and classifications of cyber risks. Aassal et al. (2020) propose a new taxonomy of phishing characteristics based on the interpretation and purpose of each characteristic. In comparison, Hindy et al. (2020) presented a taxonomy of network threats and the impact of current datasets on intrusion detection systems. A similar taxonomy was suggested by Kiwia et al. (2018). The authors presented a cyber kill chain-based taxonomy of banking Trojans features. The taxonomy built on a real-world dataset of 127 banking Trojans collected from December 2014 to January 2016 by a major U.K.-based financial organisation.

In the context of classification, Aamir et al. (2021) showed the benefits of machine learning for classifying port scans and DDoS attacks in a mixture of normal and attack traffic. Guo et al. (2020) presented a new method to improve malware classification based on entropy sequence features. The evaluation of this new method was conducted on different malware datasets.

To reconstruct attack scenarios and draw conclusions based on the evidence in the alert stream, Barzegar and Shajari (2018) use the DARPA2000 and MACCDC 2012 dataset for their research. Giudici and Raffinetti (2020) proposed a rank-based statistical model aimed at predicting the severity levels of cyber risk. The model used cyber risk data from the University of Milan. In contrast to the previous datasets, Skrjanc et al. (2018) used the older dataset KDD99 to monitor large-scale cyberattacks using a cauchy clustering method.

Amin et al. (2021) used a cyberattack dataset from the Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity to identify spatial clusters of countries with high rates of cyberattacks. In the context of cybercrime, Junger et al. (2020) examined crime scripts, key characteristics of the target company and the relationship between criminal effort and financial benefit. For their study, the authors analysed 300 cases of fraudulent activities against Dutch companies. With a similar focus on cybercrime, Mireles et al. (2019) proposed a metric framework to measure the effectiveness of the dynamic evolution of cyberattacks and defensive measures. To validate its usefulness, they used the DEFCON dataset.

Due to the rapidly changing nature of cyber risks, it is often impossible to obtain all information on them. Kim and Kim (2019) proposed an automated dataset generation system called CTIMiner that collects threat data from publicly available security reports and malware repositories. They released a dataset to the public containing about 640,000 records from 612 security reports published between January 2008 and 2019. A similar approach is proposed by Kim et al. (2020), using a named entity recognition system to extract core information from cyber threat reports automatically. They created a 498,000-tag dataset during their research (Ulven and Wangen 2021).

Within the framework of vulnerabilities and cybersecurity issues, Ulven and Wangen (2021) proposed an overview of mission-critical assets and everyday threat events, suggested a generic threat model, and summarised common cybersecurity vulnerabilities. With a focus on hospitality, Chen and Fiscus (2018) proposed several issues related to cybersecurity in this sector. They analysed 76 security incidents from the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse database. Supplementary Table 1 lists all findings that belong to the cyber causes dataset.

Impact datasets
This section outlines selected findings of the cyber impact dataset. For cyber insurers, these datasets can form an important basis for information, as they can be used to calculate cyber insurance premiums, evaluate specific cyber risks, formulate inclusions and exclusions in cyber wordings, and re-evaluate as well as supplement the data collected so far on cyber risks. For example, information on financial losses can help to better assess the loss potential of cyber risks. Furthermore, the datasets can provide insight into the frequency of occurrence of these cyber risks. The new datasets can be used to close any data gaps that were previously based on very approximate estimates or to find new results.

Eight studies addressed the costs of data breaches. For instance, Eling and Jung (2018) reviewed 3327 data breach events from 2005 to 2016 and identified an asymmetric dependence of monthly losses by breach type and industry. The authors used datasets from the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse for analysis. The Privacy Rights Clearinghouse datasets and the Breach level index database were also used by De Giovanni et al. (2020) to describe relationships between data breaches and bitcoin-related variables using the cointegration methodology. The data were obtained from the Department of Health and Human Services of healthcare facilities reporting data breaches and a national database of technical and organisational infrastructure information. Also in the context of data breaches, Algarni et al. (2021) developed a comprehensive, formal model that estimates the two components of security risks: breach cost and the likelihood of a data breach within 12 months. For their survey, the authors used two industrial reports from the Ponemon institute and VERIZON. To illustrate the scope of data breaches, Neto et al. (2021) identified 430 major data breach incidents among more than 10,000 incidents. The database created is available and covers the period 2018 to 2019.

With a direct focus on insurance, Biener et al. (2015) analysed 994 cyber loss cases from an operational risk database and investigated the insurability of cyber risks based on predefined criteria. For their study, they used data from the company SAS OpRisk Global Data. Similarly, Eling and Wirfs (2019) looked at a wide range of cyber risk events and actual cost data using the same database. They identified cyber losses and analysed them using methods from statistics and actuarial science. Using a similar reference, Farkas et al. (2021) proposed a method for analysing cyber claims based on regression trees to identify criteria for classifying and evaluating claims. Similar to Chen and Fiscus (2018), the dataset used was the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse database. Within the framework of reinsurance, Moro (2020) analysed cyber index-based information technology activity to see if index-parametric reinsurance coverage could suggest its cedant using data from a Symantec dataset.

Paté-Cornell et al. (2018) presented a general probabilistic risk analysis framework for cybersecurity in an organisation to be specified. The results are distributions of losses to cyberattacks, with and without considered countermeasures in support of risk management decisions based both on past data and anticipated incidents. The data used were from The Common Vulnerability and Exposures database and via confidential access to a database of cyberattacks on a large, U.S.-based organisation. A different conceptual framework for cyber risk classification and assessment was proposed by Sheehan et al. (2021). This framework showed the importance of proactive and reactive barriers in reducing companies’ exposure to cyber risk and quantifying the risk. Another approach to cyber risk assessment and mitigation was proposed by Mukhopadhyay et al. (2019). They estimated the probability of an attack using generalised linear models, predicted the security technology required to reduce the probability of cyberattacks, and used gamma and exponential distributions to best approximate the average loss data for each malicious attack. They also calculated the expected loss due to cyberattacks, calculated the net premium that would need to be charged by a cyber insurer, and suggested cyber insurance as a strategy to minimise losses. They used the CSI-FBI survey (1997–2010) to conduct their research.

In order to highlight the lack of data on cyber risks, Eling (2020) conducted a literature review in the areas of cyber risk and cyber insurance. Available information on the frequency, severity, and dependency structure of cyber risks was filtered out. In addition, open questions for future cyber risk research were set up. Another example of data collection on the impact of cyberattacks is provided by Sornette et al. (2013), who use a database of newspaper articles, press reports and other media to provide a predictive method to identify triggering events and potential accident scenarios and estimate their severity and frequency. A similar approach to data collection was used by Arcuri et al. (2020) to gather an original sample of global cyberattacks from newspaper reports sourced from the LexisNexis database. This collection is also used and applied to the fields of dynamic communication and cyber risk perception by Fang et al. (2021). To create a dataset of cyber incidents and disputes, Valeriano and Maness (2014) collected information on cyber interactions between rival states.

To assess trends and the scale of economic cybercrime, Levi (2017) examined datasets from different countries and their impact on crime policy. Pooser et al. (2018) investigated the trend in cyber risk identification from 2006 to 2015 and company characteristics related to cyber risk perception. The authors used a dataset of various reports from cyber insurers for their study. Walker-Roberts et al. (2020) investigated the spectrum of risk of a cybersecurity incident taking place in the cyber-physical-enabled world using the VERIS Community Database. The datasets of impacts identified are presented below. Due to overlap, some may also appear in the causes dataset (Supplementary Table 2).",technical,cybersecurity,
" Cybersecurity datasets
General intrusion detection
General intrusion detection systems account for the largest share of countermeasure datasets. For companies or researchers focused on cybersecurity, the datasets can be used to test their own countermeasures or obtain information about potential vulnerabilities. For example, Al-Omari et al. (2021) proposed an intelligent intrusion detection model for predicting and detecting attacks in cyberspace, which was applied to dataset UNSW-NB 15. A similar approach was taken by Choras and Kozik (2015), who used machine learning to detect cyberattacks on web applications. To evaluate their method, they used the HTTP dataset CSIC 2010. For the identification of unknown attacks on web servers, Kamarudin et al. (2017) proposed an anomaly-based intrusion detection system using an ensemble classification approach. Ganeshan and Rodrigues (2020) showed an intrusion detection system approach, which clusters the database into several groups and detects the presence of intrusion in the clusters. In comparison, AlKadi et al. (2019) used a localisation-based model to discover abnormal patterns in network traffic. Hybrid models have been recommended by Bhattacharya et al. (2020) and Agrawal et al. (2019); the former is a machine-learning model based on principal component analysis for the classification of intrusion detection system datasets, while the latter is a hybrid ensemble intrusion detection system for anomaly detection using different datasets to detect patterns in network traffic that deviate from normal behaviour.

Agarwal et al. (2021) used three different machine learning algorithms in their research to find the most suitable for efficiently identifying patterns of suspicious network activity. The UNSW-NB15 dataset was used for this purpose. Kasongo and Sun (2020), Feed-Forward Deep Neural Network (FFDNN), Keshk et al. (2021), the privacy-preserving anomaly detection framework, and others also use the UNSW-NB 15 dataset as part of intrusion detection systems. The same dataset and others were used by Binbusayyis and Vaiyapuri (2019) to identify and compare key features for cyber intrusion detection. Atefinia and Ahmadi (2021) proposed a deep neural network model to reduce the false positive rate of an anomaly-based intrusion detection system. Fossaceca et al. (2015) focused in their research on the development of a framework that combined the outputs of multiple learners in order to improve the efficacy of network intrusion, and Gauthama Raman et al. (2020) presented a search algorithm based on Support Vector machine to improve the performance of the detection and false alarm rate to improve intrusion detection techniques. Ahmad and Alsemmeari (2020) targeted extreme learning machine techniques due to their good capabilities in classification problems and handling huge data. They used the NSL-KDD dataset as a benchmark.

With reference to prediction, Bakdash et al. (2018) used datasets from the U.S. Department of Defence to predict cyberattacks by malware. This dataset consists of weekly counts of cyber events over approximately seven years. Another prediction method was presented by Fan et al. (2018), which showed an improved integrated cybersecurity prediction method based on spatial-time analysis. Also, with reference to prediction, Ashtiani and Azgomi (2014) proposed a framework for the distributed simulation of cyberattacks based on high-level architecture. Kirubavathi and Anitha (2016) recommended an approach to detect botnets, irrespective of their structures, based on network traffic flow behaviour analysis and machine-learning techniques. Dwivedi et al. (2021) introduced a multi-parallel adaptive technique to utilise an adaption mechanism in the group of swarms for network intrusion detection. AlEroud and Karabatis (2018) presented an approach that used contextual information to automatically identify and query possible semantic links between different types of suspicious activities extracted from network flows.

Intrusion detection systems with a focus on IoT
In addition to general intrusion detection systems, a proportion of studies focused on IoT. Habib et al. (2020) presented an approach for converting traditional intrusion detection systems into smart intrusion detection systems for IoT networks. To enhance the process of diagnostic detection of possible vulnerabilities with an IoT system, Georgescu et al. (2019) introduced a method that uses a named entity recognition-based solution. With regard to IoT in the smart home sector, Heartfield et al. (2021) presented a detection system that is able to autonomously adjust the decision function of its underlying anomaly classification models to a smart home’s changing condition. Another intrusion detection system was suggested by Keserwani et al. (2021), which combined Grey Wolf Optimization and Particle Swam Optimization to identify various attacks for IoT networks. They used the KDD Cup 99, NSL-KDD and CICIDS-2017 to evaluate their model. Abu Al-Haija and Zein-Sabatto (2020) provide a comprehensive development of a new intelligent and autonomous deep-learning-based detection and classification system for cyberattacks in IoT communication networks that leverage the power of convolutional neural networks, abbreviated as IoT-IDCS-CNN (IoT-based Intrusion Detection and Classification System using Convolutional Neural Network). To evaluate the development, the authors used the NSL-KDD dataset. Biswas and Roy (2021) recommended a model that identifies malicious botnet traffic using novel deep-learning approaches like artificial neural networks gutted recurrent units and long- or short-term memory models. They tested their model with the Bot-IoT dataset.

With a more forensic background, Koroniotis et al. (2020) submitted a network forensic framework, which described the digital investigation phases for identifying and tracing attack behaviours in IoT networks. The suggested work was evaluated with the Bot-IoT and UINSW-NB15 datasets. With a focus on big data and IoT, Chhabra et al. (2020) presented a cyber forensic framework for big data analytics in an IoT environment using machine learning. Furthermore, the authors mentioned different publicly available datasets for machine-learning models.

A stronger focus on a mobile phones was exhibited by Alazab et al. (2020), which presented a classification model that combined permission requests and application programme interface calls. The model was tested with a malware dataset containing 27,891 Android apps. A similar approach was taken by Li et al. (2019a, b), who proposed a reliable classifier for Android malware detection based on factorisation machine architecture and extraction of Android app features from manifest files and source code.

Literature reviews
In addition to the different methods and models for intrusion detection systems, various literature reviews on the methods and datasets were also found. Liu and Lang (2019) proposed a taxonomy of intrusion detection systems that uses data objects as the main dimension to classify and summarise machine learning and deep learning-based intrusion detection literature. They also presented four different benchmark datasets for machine-learning detection systems. Ahmed et al. (2016) presented an in-depth analysis of four major categories of anomaly detection techniques, which include classification, statistical, information theory and clustering. Hajj et al. (2021) gave a comprehensive overview of anomaly-based intrusion detection systems. Their article gives an overview of the requirements, methods, measurements and datasets that are used in an intrusion detection system.

Within the framework of machine learning, Chattopadhyay et al. (2018) conducted a comprehensive review and meta-analysis on the application of machine-learning techniques in intrusion detection systems. They also compared different machine learning techniques in different datasets and summarised the performance. Vidros et al. (2017) presented an overview of characteristics and methods in automatic detection of online recruitment fraud. They also published an available dataset of 17,880 annotated job ads, retrieved from the use of a real-life system. An empirical study of different unsupervised learning algorithms used in the detection of unknown attacks was presented by Meira et al. (2020).

New datasets
Kilincer et al. (2021) reviewed different intrusion detection system datasets in detail. They had a closer look at the UNS-NB15, ISCX-2012, NSL-KDD and CIDDS-001 datasets. Stojanovic et al. (2020) also provided a review on datasets and their creation for use in advanced persistent threat detection in the literature. Another review of datasets was provided by Sarker et al. (2020), who focused on cybersecurity data science as part of their research and provided an overview from a machine-learning perspective. Avila et al. (2021) conducted a systematic literature review on the use of security logs for data leak detection. They recommended a new classification of information leak, which uses the GDPR principles, identified the most widely publicly available dataset for threat detection, described the attack types in the datasets and the algorithms used for data leak detection. Tuncer et al. (2020) presented a bytecode-based detection method consisting of feature extraction using local neighbourhood binary patterns. They chose a byte-based malware dataset to investigate the performance of the proposed local neighbourhood binary pattern-based detection method. With a different focus, Mauro et al. (2020) gave an experimental overview of neural-based techniques relevant to intrusion detection. They assessed the value of neural networks using the Bot-IoT and UNSW-DB15 datasets.

Another category of results in the context of countermeasure datasets is those that were presented as new. Moreno et al. (2018) developed a database of 300 security-related accidents from European and American sources. The database contained cybersecurity-related events in the chemical and process industry. Damasevicius et al. (2020) proposed a new dataset (LITNET-2020) for network intrusion detection. The dataset is a new annotated network benchmark dataset obtained from the real-world academic network. It presents real-world examples of normal and under-attack network traffic. With a focus on IoT intrusion detection systems, Alsaedi et al. (2020) proposed a new benchmark IoT/IIot datasets for assessing intrusion detection system-enabled IoT systems. Also in the context of IoT, Vaccari et al. (2020) proposed a dataset focusing on message queue telemetry transport protocols, which can be used to train machine-learning models. To evaluate the performance of machine-learning classifiers, Mahfouz et al. (2020) created a dataset called Game Theory and Cybersecurity (GTCS). A dataset containing 22,000 malware and benign samples was constructed by Martin et al. (2019). The dataset can be used as a benchmark to test the algorithm for Android malware classification and clustering techniques. In addition, Laso et al. (2017) presented a dataset created to investigate how data and information quality estimates enable the detection of anomalies and malicious acts in cyber-physical systems. The dataset contained various cyberattacks and is publicly available.

Other
In addition to the results described above, several other studies were found that fit into the category of countermeasures. Johnson et al. (2016) examined the time between vulnerability disclosures. Using another vulnerabilities database, Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE), Subroto and Apriyana (2019) presented an algorithm model that uses big data analysis of social media and statistical machine learning to predict cyber risks. A similar databank but with a different focus, Common Vulnerability Scoring System, was used by Chatterjee and Thekdi (2020) to present an iterative data-driven learning approach to vulnerability assessment and management for complex systems. Using the CICIDS2017 dataset to evaluate the performance, Malik et al. (2020) proposed a control plane-based orchestration for varied, sophisticated threats and attacks. The same dataset was used in another study by Lee et al. (2019), who developed an artificial security information event management system based on a combination of event profiling for data processing and different artificial network methods. To exploit the interdependence between multiple series, Fang et al. (2021) proposed a statistical framework. In order to validate the framework, the authors applied it to a dataset of enterprise-level security breaches from the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse and Identity Theft Center database. Another framework with a defensive aspect was recommended by Li et al. (2021) to increase the robustness of deep neural networks against adversarial malware evasion attacks. Sarabi et al. (2016) investigated whether and to what extent business details can help assess an organisation's risk of data breaches and the distribution of risk across different types of incidents to create policies for protection, detection and recovery from different forms of security incidents. They used data from the VERIS Community Database.

Datasets that have been classified into the cybersecurity category are detailed in Supplementary Table 3. Due to overlap, records from the previous tables may also be included.

Discussion
This paper presented a systematic literature review of studies on cyber risk and cybersecurity that used datasets. Within this framework, 255 studies were fully reviewed and then classified into three different categories. Then, 79 datasets were consolidated from these studies. These datasets were subsequently analysed, and important information was selected through a process of filtering out. This information was recorded in a table and enhanced with further information as part of the literature analysis. This made it possible to create a comprehensive overview of the datasets. For example, each dataset contains a description of where the data came from and how the data has been used to date. This allows different datasets to be compared and the appropriate dataset for the use case to be selected. This research certainly has limitations, so our selection of datasets cannot necessarily be taken as a representation of all available datasets related to cyber risks and cybersecurity. For example, literature searches were conducted in four academic databases and only found datasets that were used in the literature. Many research projects also used old datasets that may no longer consider current developments. In addition, the data are often focused on only one observation and are limited in scope. For example, the datasets can only be applied to specific contexts and are also subject to further limitations (e.g. region, industry, operating system). In the context of the applicability of the datasets, it is unfortunately not possible to make a clear statement on the extent to which they can be integrated into academic or practical areas of application or how great this effort is. Finally, it remains to be pointed out that this is an overview of currently available datasets, which are subject to constant change.

Due to the lack of datasets on cyber risks in the academic literature, additional datasets on cyber risks were integrated as part of a further search. The search was conducted on the Google Dataset search portal. The search term used was ‘cyber risk datasets’. Over 100 results were found. However, due to the low significance and verifiability, only 20 selected datasets were included. These can be found in Table 2 in the “Appendix”.

The results of the literature review and datasets also showed that there continues to be a lack of available, open cyber datasets. This lack of data is reflected in cyber insurance, for example, as it is difficult to find a risk-based premium without a sufficient database (Nurse et al. 2020). The global cyber insurance market was estimated at USD 5.5 billion in 2020 (Dyson 2020). When compared to the USD 1 trillion global losses from cybercrime (Maleks Smith et al. 2020), it is clear that there exists a significant cyber risk awareness challenge for both the insurance industry and international commerce. Without comprehensive and qualitative data on cyber losses, it can be difficult to estimate potential losses from cyberattacks and price cyber insurance accordingly (GAO 2021). For instance, the average cyber insurance loss increased from USD 145,000 in 2019 to USD 359,000 in 2020 (FitchRatings 2021). Cyber insurance is an important risk management tool to mitigate the financial impact of cybercrime. This is particularly evident in the impact of different industries. In the Energy & Commodities financial markets, a ransomware attack on the Colonial Pipeline led to a substantial impact on the U.S. economy. As a result of the attack, about 45% of the U.S. East Coast was temporarily unable to obtain supplies of diesel, petrol and jet fuel. This caused the average price in the U.S. to rise 7 cents to USD 3.04 per gallon, the highest in seven years (Garber 2021). In addition, Colonial Pipeline confirmed that it paid a USD 4.4 million ransom to a hacker gang after the attack. Another ransomware attack occurred in the healthcare and government sector. The victim of this attack was the Irish Health Service Executive (HSE). A ransom payment of USD 20 million was demanded from the Irish government to restore services after the hack (Tidy 2021). In the car manufacturing sector, Miller and Valasek (2015) initiated a cyberattack that resulted in the recall of 1.4 million vehicles and cost manufacturers EUR 761 million. The risk that arises in the context of these events is the potential for the accumulation of cyber losses, which is why cyber insurers are not expanding their capacity. An example of this accumulation of cyber risks is the NotPetya malware attack, which originated in Russia, struck in Ukraine, and rapidly spread around the world, causing at least USD 10 billion in damage (GAO 2021). These events highlight the importance of proper cyber risk management.

This research provides cyber insurance stakeholders with an overview of cyber datasets. Cyber insurers can use the open datasets to improve their understanding and assessment of cyber risks. For example, the impact datasets can be used to better measure financial impacts and their frequencies. These data could be combined with existing portfolio data from cyber insurers and integrated with existing pricing tools and factors to better assess cyber risk valuation. Although most cyber insurers have sparse historical cyber policy and claims data, they remain too small at present for accurate prediction (Bessy-Roland et al. 2021). A combination of portfolio data and external datasets would support risk-adjusted pricing for cyber insurance, which would also benefit policyholders. In addition, cyber insurance stakeholders can use the datasets to identify patterns and make better predictions, which would benefit sustainable cyber insurance coverage. In terms of cyber risk cause datasets, cyber insurers can use the data to review their insurance products. For example, the data could provide information on which cyber risks have not been sufficiently considered in product design or where improvements are needed. A combination of cyber cause and cybersecurity datasets can help establish uniform definitions to provide greater transparency and clarity. Consistent terminology could lead to a more sustainable cyber market, where cyber insurers make informed decisions about the level of coverage and policyholders understand their coverage (The Geneva Association 2020).

In addition to the cyber insurance community, this research also supports cybersecurity stakeholders. The reviewed literature can be used to provide a contemporary, contextual and categorised summary of available datasets. This supports efficient and timely progress in cyber risk research and is beneficial given the dynamic nature of cyber risks. With the help of the described cybersecurity datasets and the identified information, a comparison of different datasets is possible. The datasets can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of countermeasures in simulated cyberattacks or to test intrusion detection systems.

Conclusion
In this paper, we conducted a systematic review of studies on cyber risk and cybersecurity databases. We found that most of the datasets are in the field of intrusion detection and machine learning and are used for technical cybersecurity aspects. The available datasets on cyber risks were relatively less represented. Due to the dynamic nature and lack of historical data, assessing and understanding cyber risk is a major challenge for cyber insurance stakeholders. To address this challenge, a greater density of cyber data is needed to support cyber insurers in risk management and researchers with cyber risk-related topics. With reference to ‘Open Science’ FAIR data (Jacobsen et al. 2020), mandatory reporting of cyber incidents could help improve cyber understanding, awareness and loss prevention among companies and insurers. Through greater availability of data, cyber risks can be better understood, enabling researchers to conduct more in-depth research into these risks. Companies could incorporate this new knowledge into their corporate culture to reduce cyber risks. For insurance companies, this would have the advantage that all insurers would have the same understanding of cyber risks, which would support sustainable risk-based pricing. In addition, common definitions of cyber risks could be derived from new data.

The cybersecurity databases summarised and categorised in this research could provide a different perspective on cyber risks that would enable the formulation of common definitions in cyber policies. The datasets can help companies addressing cybersecurity and cyber risk as part of risk management assess their internal cyber posture and cybersecurity measures. The paper can also help improve risk awareness and corporate behaviour, and provides the research community with a comprehensive overview of peer-reviewed datasets and other available datasets in the area of cyber risk and cybersecurity. This approach is intended to support the free availability of data for research. The complete tabulated review of the literature is included in the Supplementary Material.

This work provides directions for several paths of future work. First, there are currently few publicly available datasets for cyber risk and cybersecurity. The older datasets that are still widely used no longer reflect today's technical environment. Moreover, they can often only be used in one context, and the scope of the samples is very limited. It would be of great value if more datasets were publicly available that reflect current environmental conditions. This could help intrusion detection systems to consider current events and thus lead to a higher success rate. It could also compensate for the disadvantages of older datasets by collecting larger quantities of samples and making this contextualisation more widespread. Another area of research may be the integratability and adaptability of cybersecurity and cyber risk datasets. For example, it is often unclear to what extent datasets can be integrated or adapted to existing data. For cyber risks and cybersecurity, it would be helpful to know what requirements need to be met or what is needed to use the datasets appropriately. In addition, it would certainly be helpful to know whether datasets can be modified to be used for cyber risks or cybersecurity. Finally, the ability for stakeholders to identify machine-readable cybersecurity datasets would be useful because it would allow for even clearer delineations or comparisons between datasets. Due to the lack of publicly available datasets, concrete benchmarks often cannot be applied.",technical,cybersecurity,
" Introduction
Cybersecurity 1 covers the broad range of technical, organisational and governance issues that must be considered to protect networked information systems against accidental and deliberate threats. It goes well beyond the details of encryption, firewalls, anti-virus software, and similar technical security tools. This breadth is captured in the widely used International Telecommunication Union (ITU) definition (ITU-T, 2008, p. 2):

Cybersecurity is the collection of tools, policies, security concepts, security safeguards, guidelines, risk management approaches, actions, training, best practices, assurance and technologies that can be used to protect the cyber environment and organization and user’s assets. Organization and user’s assets include connected computing devices, personnel, infrastructure, applications, services, telecommunications systems, and the totality of transmitted and/or stored information in the cyber environment. Cybersecurity strives to ensure the attainment and maintenance of the security properties of the organization and user’s assets against relevant security risks in the cyber environment

The importance of cybersecurity has increased as so many government, business, and day-to-day activities around the world have moved online. But especially in emerging economies, “[m]any organizations digitizing their activities lack organizational, technological and human resources, and other fundamental ingredients needed to secure their system, which is the key for the long-term success” (Kshetri, 2016, p. 3).

The more technically-focused information security is still in widespread use in computer science. But as these issues have become of much greater societal concern as “software is eating the world” (Andreessen, 2011), cybersecurity has become more frequently used, not only in the rhetorics of democratic governments as in the 2000s, but also in general academic literature (shown in Figure 1):

A graph showing the increase of the usage of the term cybersecurity versus information-, data-, or computer- security
Figure 1: Academic articles with cybersecurity/cyber-security/cyber security versus information security, data security and computer security in title, keywords or abstract of Web of Science indexed publications over time. Small numbers of records exist for both information security and computer security in the database since 1969. Data from Web of Science.
Barely used in academic literature before 1990 (except in relation to the Cray CYBER 205 supercomputer from the late 1970s), cyber became ubiquitous as a prefix, adjective and even noun by the mid-1990s, with Google Scholar returning results across a broad range of disciplines with titles such as ‘Love, sex, & power on the cyber frontier’ (1995), ‘Surfing in Seattle: What cyber-patrons want’ (1995), ‘The cyber-road not taken’ (1994) and even the ‘Cyber Dada Manifesto” (1991).

It evolved from Wiener’s cybernetics, a “field of control and communication theory, whether in machine or in the animal” (1948)—derived from the Greek word for ‘steersman’—with an important intermediate point being the popular usage of cyborg, a contraction of cybernetic organism, alongside the Czech-derived robot (Clarke, 2005, section 2.4). The notion of a ‘governor’ of a machine goes back to the mid-19th century, with J. C. Maxwell (discoverer of the electron) noting in 1868 it is “a part of a machine by means of which the velocity of the machine is kept nearly uniform, notwithstanding variations in the driving-power or the resistance” (Maxwell, 1868, p. 270)—what Wiener called homeostasis.

The use of cyberspace to refer to the electronic communications environment was coined in William Gibson’s 1982 short story Burning Chrome (“widespread, interconnected digital technology”) and popularised by his 1984 science fiction novel Neuromancer (“a graphic representation of data abstracted from the banks of every computer in the human system […] lines of light ranged in the nonspace of mind, clusters and constellations of data […] a consensual hallucination experienced by millions”). Cyberspace’s arrival in legal and policy discussions was spearheaded by John Perry Barlow’s Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace (1996). But by 2000, Gibson declared cyberspace was “evocative and essentially meaningless ... suggestive ... but with no real meaning” (Neale, 2000).

Despite its ubiquity in present-day national security and defence-related discussions, Wagner and Vieth found: “Cyber ​​and cyberspace, however, are not synonymous words and have developed different meanings [...] Cyber ​​is increasingly becoming a metaphor for threat scenarios and the necessary militarisation” (2016). Matwyshyn suggested the term is “the consequence of a cultural divide between the two [US] coasts: ‘cybersecurity’ is the Washington, D.C. legal rebranding for what Silicon Valley veterans have historically usually called ‘infosec’ or simply ‘security’” (2017, p. 1158). Cybersecurity issues have, to many whose interests are served by the interpretation, become national security issues (Clarke, 2016; Kemmerer, 2003; Nissenbaum, 2005).

A review by Craigen et al. (2014) found cybersecurity used in a range of literature and fields from 2003 onwards, including software engineering, international relations, crisis management and public safety. Social scientists interacting with policymakers, and academics generally applying for research and translation funding from government sources and interacting with the defence and signals intelligence/information security agencies that are the cybersecurity centres of expertise in many larger governments, have further popularised the term, 2 which appears in similar form in many languages, as shown in Appendix 1.

Looking beyond academia to literature more widely, Figure 2 shows computer security was most prevalent in the Google Books corpus from 1974, overtaken by information security in 1997, and cybersecurity in 2015 (with cyber security increasingly popular since 1996, but cyber-security negligible the entire period). Computer (Ware, 1970), system, and data (Denning, 1982) security were all frequently used as closely-related terms in the 1970s (Saltzer & Schroeder, 1975). 3

This trend is unfortunate, since “using the term ‘cybersecurity’ seems to imply that information security issues are limited to code connected to the Internet [but] physical security of machines and human manipulability through social engineering are always key aspects of information security in both the private and public sector” (Matwyshyn, 2017, p. 1156).

Cybersecurity in early context
In computer science, attacks on the security of information systems are usually concerned with:

Breaching the confidentiality of systems, with data exposed to unauthorised actors;
Undermining the integrity of systems, and disruption of the accuracy, consistency or trustworthiness of information being processed;
Affecting the availability of systems, and rendering them offline, unusable or non-functional.
Together, confidentiality, integrity and availability are called the CIA triad, and have been the basis of information security since the late 1970s (Neumann et al., 1977, pp. 11–14). Echoing this history decades later, the Council of Europe’s 2001 Budapest Convention on Cybercrime set out in its first substantive section “Offences against the confidentiality, integrity and availability of computer data and systems”.

Cybersecurity across disciplines
The study and practice of cybersecurity spans a range of disciplines and fields. In this article, we consider three of the main angles important to cybersecurity practice: technical aspects; human factors; and legal dimensions. This is necessarily an incomplete list—notably, the topic is also the subject of study by those who are interested in, for example, how it reconfigures organisational structures (information systems), or relationships between actors such as states (international relations), and significant non-state actors such as organised crime gangs (criminology).

Technical aspects
Many technical domains are of direct relevance to cybersecurity, but the field designed to synthesise technical knowledge in practical contexts has become known as security engineering: “building systems to remain dependable in the face of malice, error, or mischance” (Anderson, 2008, p. 3). It concerns the confluence of four aspects—policy (the security aim), mechanisms (technologies to implement the policy), assurance (the reliability of each mechanism) and incentives (of both attackers and defenders). Security engineers may be intellectually grounded in a specialised technical domain, but they require a range of bridging and boundary skills between other disciplines of research and practice.

A daunting (and worsening) challenge for security engineers is posed by the complexities of the sociotechnical environments in which they operate. Technological systems have always evolved and displayed interdependencies, but today infrastructures and individual devices are networked and co-dependent in ways which challenge any ability to unilaterally “engineer” a situation. Systems are increasingly servitised, (e.g., through external APIs) with information flows not under the control of the system engineer, and code subject to constant ‘agile’ evolution and change which may undermine desired system properties (Kostova et al., 2020).

Human factors and social sciences
The field of human factors in cybersecurity grew from the observation that much of the time “hackers pay more attention to the human link in the security chain than security designers” (Adams & Sasse, 1999, p. 41), leaving many sensitive systems wide open to penetration by “social engineering” (Mitnick & Simon, 2002).

It is now very problematic to draw cybersecurity’s conceptual boundaries around an organisation’s IT department, software vendors and employer-managed hardware, as in practice networked technologies have permeated and reconfigured social interactions in all aspects of life. Users often adapt technologies in unexpected ways (Silverstone & Hirsch, 1992) and create their own new networked spaces (Cohen, 2012; Zittrain, 2006), reliant on often-incomprehensible security tools (Whitten & Tygar, 1999) that merely obstruct individuals in carrying out their intended tasks (Sasse et al., 2001). Networked spaces to be secured—the office, the university, the city, the electoral system—cannot be boxed-off and separated from technology in society more broadly. Communities often run their networked services, such as a website, messaging group, or social media pages, without dedicated cybersecurity support. Even in companies, or governments, individuals or groups with cybersecurity functions differ widely in location, autonomy, capabilities, and authority. The complexity of securing such a global assemblage, made up of billions of users as well as hundreds of millions of connected devices, has encouraged a wider cross-disciplinary focus on improving the security of these planetary-scale systems, with social sciences as an important component (Chang, 2012).

Research focussed on the interaction between cybersecurity and society has also expanded the relevant set of risks and actors involved. While the term cybersecurity is often used interchangeably with information security (and thus in terms of the CIA triad), this only represents a subset of cybersecurity risks.

Insofar as all security concerns the protection of certain assets from threats posed by attackers exploiting vulnerabilities, the assets at stake in a digital context need not just be information, but could, for example, be people (through cyberbullying, manipulation or intimate partner abuse) or critical infrastructures (von Solms & van Niekerk, 2013). Moreover, traditional threat models in both information and cybersecurity can be limited. For example, domestic abusers are rarely considered as a threat actor (Levy & Schneier, 2020) and systems are rarely designed to protect their intended users from the authenticated but adversarial users typical in intimate partner abuse (Freed et al., 2018).

The domain of cyber-physical security further captures the way in which cybersecurity threats interact with physically located sensors and actuators. A broader flavour of definition than has been previously typical is used in the recent EU Cybersecurity Act (Regulation 2019/881), which in Article 2(1) defines cybersecurity as “the activities necessary to protect network and information systems, the users of such systems, and other persons affected by cyber threats” [emphasis added]. The difficult interaction between information systems, societies and environments is rapidly gaining traction in the research literature.

Research at the intersection of human–computer interaction and cybersecurity has also pointed to challenges of usability and acceptability in deploying approaches developed in fields such as security engineering. Consider the encryption of information flowing across the internet using Transport Layer Security (TLS), a protocol which is able to cryptographically authenticate the endpoints and protect the confidentiality and integrity of transmitted data. TLS raises usability challenges in relation to developers’ and administrators’ understanding of how it works and thus how to correctly implement it (Krombholz et al., 2017, 2019) as well as challenges with communicating its properties—and what to do in its absence—to end users in their web browsers (Felt et al., 2015; Reeder et al., 2018). Focusing on the user experience of the web browser, Camp (2013) suggests principles of translucent security: high security defaults, single-click override, context-specific settings, personalised settings, and use-based settings.

Related challenges faced by both users and developers or other specialists are found widely across the cybersecurity field, including passwords (e.g., Naiakshina et al., 2019) and encrypted email (Whitten & Tygar, 1999). The field of usable security seeks a fit between the security task and the humans expected to interact with it (Sasse et al., 2001). Without an understanding of issues such as these, the techniques used can bring at best a false sense of security, and at worst, entirely new threat vectors.",technical,cybersecurity,
" In a significant forecast from the 2025 Cybersecurity Trends Report, UK organisations are gearing up for a substantial increase in cybersecurity budgets, projecting an average growth of 31% in 2025.

This figure not only outpaces the global forecast of a 15% increase by Gartner but also highlights the heightened focus on cybersecurity in the region. With the 30th edition of Infosecurity Europe on the horizon, set to be held from 3-5 June 2025 at ExCeL London, the event promises to be a pivotal moment for the industry, reflecting on three decades of advancements and the future trajectory of cybersecurity.

As organisations brace for escalating cyber threats, the investment priorities are distinctly aligned towards enhancing application security, network security, cloud security, and DevSecOps. This strategic allocation of resources underscores a collective effort to stay ahead of sophisticated cyber threats. Moreover, a significant 71% of organisations believe their budgets are sufficient to maintain cybersecurity, although there remains a notable gap, with 8% indicating a lack of necessary funds.

The report also sheds light on the challenges within the industry, particularly the 47% of cybersecurity professionals who find it difficult to engage at a strategic board level. This disconnect underscores the critical need for better communication and alignment between technical teams and corporate leadership to enhance corporate resilience and strategic decision-making.

Compounding the challenge is the struggle to foster a strong cybersecurity culture, hindered by insufficient resources and the absence of clear, organisation-wide cybersecurity strategies. As Infosecurity Europe enters its 30th year under the theme “Building a Safer Cyber World,” the event is set to introduce several enhancements. These include new conference tracks, networking opportunities, and tools to assist attendees in navigating the evolving cybersecurity landscape effectively.

Brad Maule-ffinch, Event Director at Infosecurity Europe, emphasized the overhaul in their approach, particularly in how conference sessions are tagged and described, aiming to optimize the attendee experience. He highlighted the expansion of the Infosec Meets platform and the introduction of more guidance for discovering new technologies, reinforcing the event’s role in fostering a collaborative and informed cybersecurity community.

To celebrate its 30th anniversary, Infosecurity Europe will host a variety of events, including sessions led by Hall of Fame alumni like Rik Ferguson, Vice President Security Intelligence at Forescout Technologies, Inc. Ferguson commented on the evolving nature of cybersecurity: “Building a cyber-safe world today goes far beyond protecting data and systems. It encompasses safeguarding the critical infrastructure that underpins our global economy and, quite literally, keeps the lights on. Security must be foundational, baked into every aspect of our digital lives because the reality is, no one is an island.”",technical,cybersecurity,
" Top Skills Required to Start Your Career in Cybersecurity
March 19, 2024
| Leaman Crews
| Cybersecurity Technician
Have you been thinking of a career in cybersecurity? It certainly is a good time to do so. Cybersecurity is one of the fastest-growing career fields, with strong demand from employers and a shortage of qualified employees. There are opportunities in nearly every industry, offering good salaries with long-term job security.

To start a cybersecurity career or transition into the field, you must do a quick self-assessment. The concepts can be learned, but it will help if you already possess some of the skills for cybersecurity. Anyone with an excellent approach to problem-solving and attention to detail already has entry-level cyber security skills. With the right kind of thinking and a solid work ethic, you could already be well on your way to a fast-paced, rewarding career.

Considering a Cybersecurity Career: Why Choose It?
Considering any career, whether you’re just entering the workforce or looking for a new job, can raise some concerns. You may wonder if it’s the right move or if you should choose something else. However, there’s never been a better time to start your career in cybersecurity. It’s a career with and opportunities in several different roles. For example, information security analyst jobs are predicted to grow by 32% between now and 2032 (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics).

Experts expect cybersecurity hiring to remain strong for the foreseeable future (Fortune, 2023). As companies return to normal following the Covid-19 pandemic, the way business is done has changed. Remote work has gone from a unique case for field salespeople and branch offices to something more common. Today, the cloud connects employees globally like no one could have imagined just a few years ago (Grand View Research, 2023). This increased adoption of the cloud has only increased the need for information security professionals.

Essential Skills for Entering Field Cybersecurity
So, what are the essential skills needed for cyber security? At the top of the list are problem-solving skills. Day in and day out, cybersecurity professionals are called to address complex issues in creative ways. New information security threats always emerge, requiring cybersecurity pros to think quickly and apply their existing knowledge. Attention to detail, strong analytical skills, and the ability to evaluate the most minute details go a long way in a cybersecurity career.

As an information security worker, you’ll need excellent communication skills. You’ll work with many different people in a wide range of roles from nearly every department. The ability to clearly explain security issues, their impact, and how to address them is critical. At specific points, you’ll be required to speak in technical language. At others, you’ll need to explain things in ways that your non-technical co-workers can understand.

Your next move should be to look for a certification that not only equips you with the foundational technical aspects of cybersecurity but also provides thorough hands-on practice. The best courses will provide extensive lab time so that you can learn and practice in real-world scenarios while building problem-solving skills.

" Technical Cyber Security
Cyber security encompasses human, physical and technical aspects. It is often important to look at the three sections of cyber security to address issues or devise security plans. 

Technical cyber security as its own entity focuses on using a wide range of skills, expertise and knowledge to keep people, companies and their data safe. This aspect of cyber security involves using cutting-edge tools and techniques to assess security vulnerabilities and weaknesses, and to mitigate against them. This is done in various ways and with the work of a range of professionals. 

One way in which technical cyber security is used to protect us is through the use of ethical hacking. This is also referred to as penetration testing. Ethical hacking involves a company or organisation hiring a penetration tester to essentially hack into their networks. Simulating a real cyber attack, the penetration testers can reveal flaws and gaps in security which a hacker could potentially exploit, allowing the necessary steps to be taken to prevent this from ever happening. 

Technical cyber security roles are also responsible for the development of strategies and security tools to protect networks and systems. They can devise plans to prevent attack, and create responses to attacks should they occur. 

It is essential for technical teams to be aware of, and to understand, the evolving threat landscape, for example new vulnerabilities and viruses. Technical cyber security researchers will undertake work such as grasping how the virus manifests, and developing software to protect against this virus or fight it should its attack prove successful. Understanding and fighting malware is a key role in technical cyber security. 

Finally, some of those working in technical cyber security will design cryptography to protect important and confidential data. This means that in the event that systems are hacked and data is stolen, the sensitive information will not be revealed due to its encrypted nature. These teams will also assess encryptions to decipher them where necessary. 

Overall, technical cyber security focuses on using technology to not only provide help in the case of cyber attacks, but also to defend against and prevent these attacks from occurring in the first place. Understanding physical and human cyber security too will emphasise the ways in which these entities are separate but often come together to solve issues. ",technical,cybersecurity,
" These 10 steps can help CISOs and other cyber pros deal with the inevitable change they will face in an industry constantly challenged by new technology, widening business responsibilities, and an ever-evolving threat landscape.

If there’s one thing that’s inevitable in cybersecurity, it’s change. Ever-evolving technology requires new protections, threats seem to multiply and morph on a daily basis, and even the humblest pieces of software and hardware demand constant updating to stay secure.

That work has been increasing as the importance, visibility, and impact of security initiatives have ramped up in recent years. Now, more than ever, security programs often require stakeholders within and sometimes even outside an organization to change workflows, practices, and behaviors.

A disciplined approach to change management in security is a must, says Ken Knapton, who provides CISO and CIO services through his IT services firm Rocky Mountain CIO. “The idea is, if you’re going to make changes, there is a path you have to bring people down and it starts with ‘Here’s what we want to do,’” Knapton tells CSO.

To effectively lead organizations through change, Knapton uses a chart that maps the multiple steps necessary to successfully adopt new ways of working. The chart plots the movement from awareness and understanding of the desired change through compliance and adoption to, ultimately, internalization. It also lists the myriad consequences of resistance (including sabotage and canceled projects).

Knapton had successfully used this approach as a CIO. As he has more recently taken on CISO duties, he’s applying those same change-management skills to ensure that new security processes, policies, and technologies are adopted effectively.

Cybersecurity leaders need to widen their change-management skills
“Too often security leaders say, ‘We are going to do this because we have to’ without helping people along the path. That’s because they think everyone is going to jump on board. But that doesn’t work,” Knapton says.

“You have to be constantly looking at how people are reacting to change and help them move along the positive path from acceptance [to internalization].”

To be sure, CISOs have long had some change management work as part of their responsibilities.

“Most CISOs are running significant initiatives including cloud migration; zero trust architecture; technology upgrades; proactive threat hunting; and insider threat, digital identity, and human risk management programs. Far from being purely technology programs, these initiatives require a fair dose of people, process, oversight, and technology knowledge,” says Jinan Budge, a vice president and analyst at Forrester Research.

“The opportunity to implement broad change in an organization requires a new breed of skills,” she adds.

With that in mind, here are 10 steps CISOs looking to up their change management effectiveness may find worth trying.

1. Seize the role
“Change happens all the time, everywhere, whether you notice it or not. This leaves the CISO with a simple choice: Drive change or follow it,” says Budge, author of “A CISO’s Guide To Leading Change.”

She advises CISOs to seize the role of change agent and be willing to lead others forward. “CISOs need to decide if they’re primarily a leader or a techie,” she explains. “This is a conscious decision that a CISO has to make at some point in their career – how much of their current success is a result of their technical knowledge, and how much is the result of their ability to collaborate and persuade. They will eventually need to stand up as a leader, not hunker down behind a keyboard.”

2. Start early
Security should never be an afterthought; the change management process shouldn’t be, either, says Michael Monday, a managing director in the security and privacy practice at global consulting firm Protiviti.

“The change management process should start early, before changing out the technology or process,” he says. “There should be some messages going out to those who are going to be impacted letting them know, [otherwise] users will be surprised, they won’t know what’s going on, business will push back and there will be confusion.”

3. Focus on the business benefits
Effective CISOs drive security changes by focusing on the business benefits those changes bring, Monday says.

Monday has seen the evidence: He worked with a CISO at a financial services company that led a password policy change impacting the firm’s customers. The CISO teamed up with business leaders to anticipate customer concerns and craft messages on why the password policy changes would help deter fraud and better safeguard the customers’ assets. “The communication was put in business terms,” Monday says.

4. Identify then lean on allies
Like others, seasoned security leader Ed Moyle has seen an increasing need for CISOs to shepherd teams through new ways of work as a result of a security need — necessitated by, for example, a new regulatory requirement or an organization-wide initiative such as a move to a zero-trust framework.

“It’s often the CISO who now has to push these new things,” says Moyle, a former CISO, founding partner of the firm SecurityCurve, and a member of the Emerging Trends Working Group with the professional association ISACA. In his experience, Moyle says he has seen some workers more willing to change than others and learned to enlist those workers as allies to help him achieve his goals. He says CISOs should identify such workers and have them champion both the “why” behind the change and act as ambassadors and guides for the change.

Nick Kramer, leader of applied solutions at SSA & Co., a global consulting firm advising companies on strategic execution, similarly advises CISOs to seek out and organize influencers as a way to drive needed change.

“Start with them,” Kramer says. Get them to understand the reasons for the change and work with them to identify “the really practical things you need to do to implement change. Set up teams of cross-functional stakeholders and give them clear charters and clear success milestones. These are the ones who will influence and support their peers, who can explain [what’s happening] in ways that peers understand and believe, and who can explain all that in the right tone and in the right language and in the right context of experience.”

5. Collaborate with impacted stakeholders
Like most security chiefs, Kyle Lai has faced pushback on security initiatives he has led. He cites as case in point a past effort to insert security into an existing DevOps practice. Even though the company had a top-down culture, where teams were expected to follow executive directives, Lai says developers didn’t rush to embrace the security processes he was introducing into their workflow.

“They were more like, ‘We’re happy to do this, as long as you don’t slow us down,’” says Lai, president and CISO with KLC Consulting.

Lai addressed such concerns head-on, demonstrating how the new security measures — such as vulnerability scans — would enable, not detract, from the speediness the DevOps teams valued and would help teams to ultimately deliver better products overall.

He also identified team members who would make good security champions, trained them on the new processes, incentivized them to spread the word and sought their input.“They had the right knowledge to communicate to their community and they could reach back to us when there were issues or concerns. It helped us figure out what would actually work well,” Lai says.

6. Focus on the 3 Ps
To successfully manage change, Budge also advises CISOs to “always think of the 3 Ps: people, process, and politics.”

When it comes to the people portion, she tells CISOs to “feed supporters and manage detractors.”

As for process, “identify the key players for the security program and understand their perspective. There are influencers, budget holders, visionaries, and other stakeholders — each of which needs to be heard, and persuaded, especially if they’re a detractor.”

And when it comes to politics, CISOs must view it as “an opportunity to understand and engage people. It’s essential to understand how people at different levels are likely to react to the strategy and steer them toward the correct outcome once you present it for consideration. In a corporate environment, politics is not an optional activity. So, sit down and listen without judgment.”

She “has seen CISOs avoid politics, and miss out on understanding why their stakeholders will not support them” but has also observed CISOs who treat politics as an “opportunity,” citing one CISO who found that “if you understand what people are actually saying as part of raising their comments and take that as an opportunity to turn their concern into a solution, it becomes a different conversation.”

7. Build up trust, goodwill
Moyle says his experience shows that people are willing to follow his lead if they already trust him and have a good rapport. So he has seized on opportunities to create that goodwill in advance, knowing it pays off.

For example, when new documentation requirements were introduced to an engineering team, he offered to work with team members to fill in the needed information. He says the move built political capital. “It was about being a trusted partner and someone who is willing to help. So, when the time came to get new security things done, I was able to leverage that goodwill.”

8. Enlist other executives
Some CISOs may find that, either because of their position in the org chart or because of the organization’s culture, they “aren’t elevated enough to carry the umph needed to lead change” on their own, so they need to lean on the CIO or other executives, Monday says.

In such cases, CISOs should be ready to educate their executive partners on the details of the security change that needs to happen and the why behind it but then let the “We must change come from others at the top,” Monday adds.

9. Hire staff skilled in change management
Budge is emphatic about this step, saying “Always, always, always hire at least one person, if not a team, of change managers with formal change management skills.”

10. Tackle any organization-wide resistance to change
Security executive Tyson Kopczynski says CISOs have increasingly become successful change agents who are able to rally others to their visions. Just look at any organization that has successfully moved to more secure ways of authentication in recent years, he says.

“To do that, CISOs have to orchestrate across the entire organization. They start by building demand and then lead the change,” he says.

“But while a lot of CISOs are mastering this capability and this skill, the overall organization in many cases is dysfunctional when it comes to digital change. And if the overall organization doesn’t have the capacity to change, then the CISO as an agent of change is not scalable,” Kopczynski says. “There are only so many things that the CISO can lean into before hitting that proverbial wall. This is a fundamental falling down point for many organizations.”

Kopczynski, co-founder and CISO in Resident of the Professional Association of CISOs as well as the author of the post “The Perils of Poor Change Management”, says CISOs in such cases must find ways to not only guide security-related changes but also inspire the organization to embrace change in general.

“You have to build a case around the organization itself building those capabilities by working with the CTO, business leaders, product folks,” he explains. “The CISO has to say, ‘We need to build this capability and have it function across the various business lines, so we can sustain change and move faster. So the next step for a CISO to mature themselves is to say, ‘I’ve got to work upstream.’ It’s an opportunity for them to show they are true business leaders.”",technical,cybersecurity,
" As seen throughout 2024, the United States homeland in 2025 faces an increasingly complex landscape of cyber and advanced technology threats that challenge traditional security frameworks. Nation-state actors, particularly China and Russia, continue to pose the most significant risks through sophisticated cyber campaigns targeting critical infrastructure. For example, China’s “Volt Typhoon” campaign has pre-positioned cyber tools for potential attacks during periods of tension, showing how threats have evolved from simple disruption to strategic positioning for future conflicts.  

The emergence of “Ransomware 3.0” represents a concerning development in cyber threats. This variant incorporates multifaceted extortion techniques that simultaneously target both public and private sectors. Triple extortion tactics – where attackers not only encrypt data but also threaten to leak sensitive information and disrupt operations – are becoming more common. Additionally, the proliferation of Cyber Crime-as-a-Service (CaaS) platforms democratizes advanced attack capabilities, enabling less-sophisticated actors to execute complex operations.  

Recent incidents underscore these risks. For instance, ransomware attacks in 2024 targeted healthcare providers like Change Healthcare, causing billions in losses, while breaches at organizations such as National Public Data exposed nearly three billion records, affecting up to 170 mission people. And one must not overlook small and medium-sized enterprises, including educational institutions, hospitals, and charities that also have been heavily targeted in recent years. These cases highlight the growing sophistication and scale of ransomware campaigns.  

More broadly, adversaries are already harvesting encrypted data with the intention of decrypting it once quantum computing capabilities mature, creating a long-term security risk for sensitive information. While fully operational quantum computers remain somewhere out on the horizon, the timeline is narrowing. To mitigate this threat, efforts like the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization project are critical in developing encryption methods resistant to quantum decryption. This is no longer just a government national security imperative. Any business dealing with sensitive data should be taking steps today to mitigate this future threat.  

The rapid advances in artificial intelligence (AI) also present a new range of security challenges. Threat actors, for example, are leveraging generative AI to create convincing deepfakes, enhance phishing campaigns, and automate malware development at unprecedented scales. AI-powered phishing attacks in 2024 used personalized messages that bypassed traditional detection systems, and we should expect this trend to continue. Though not widely discussed, the proliferation of unmonitored or unsanctioned AI systems within organizations may compound vulnerabilities. Employees using unauthorized AI tools may inadvertently expose sensitive corporate or personal data to public AI models. These tools often bypass established security frameworks, increasing risks of data breaches and compliance violations. The homeland security implications of shadow AI systems are particularly concerning. Nation-state actors may be able to exploit them to gain persistent access to organizations, while critical infrastructure remains vulnerable if shadow AI interacts with operational technology.  

Finally, we are seeing a convergence of physical and digital threats that requires increased attention. The use of unmanned aerial vehicles (drones) over critical infrastructure sites poses new risks. Recent incidents involving drones surveilling energy facilities highlight vulnerabilities in securing physical assets. Economic espionage campaigns – particularly from China – continue targeting emerging technologies and intellectual property through vulnerable supply chains. High-profile breaches in 2024 exposed weaknesses in open-source software ecosystems, emphasizing the need for robust supply chain security measures.  

To address these evolving threats, U.S. security leaders should continue to prioritize stronger public-private partnerships. Collaboration between government agencies and the U.S. private sector remains essential for sharing threat intelligence and developing coordinated responses. Leaders should likewise seek to accelerate the adoption of quantum-safe algorithms that will safeguard sensitive data against future decryption risks. Work underway to establish clear AI governance frameworks should be complemented by clear policies for mitigating shadow AI risks in organizations. With critical infrastructure coming under frequent threats of attack, organizations would do well to align with the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency’s strategic plan to reduce risks to critical infrastructure through public-private collaboration and improved threat detection. And finally, the nation would benefit from increased focus on training and education to build the country’s cybersecurity – and broader STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) – workforce.  ",technical,cybersecurity,
" Cybersecurity and operational resilience
Despite notable law enforcement successes last year, the consensus across the global cybersecurity community is that there will be no reduction in the severity and frequency of incidents in 2025. While ransomware remains a key concern, the recent attack on U.S. telecommunications companies by Salt Typhoon illustrated the sophistication and prevalence of nation-state affiliated threat actors undertaking cyber espionage. 

Other features of a very challenging cybersecurity landscape include the risks presented by cyber terrorism, hacktivism, and insider threats, as well as non-traditional attack vectors and the possibility of generative AI being used to enhance attacker capabilities. 

On the resilience side, the CrowdStrike outage in July 2024 caused by a defective software update highlighted the problem of risk concentration in global IT supply chains; an issue that organizations and regulators will be seeking to address throughout 2025 and beyond.

Cybersecurity legal and regulatory reform
Against that backdrop, new laws and regulations focusing on cybersecurity and operational resilience are either coming into force or are likely to see enforcement activity for the first time. Examples include:

the Australian Cyber Security Act 2024, which notably includes ransomware reporting requirements;
the new tiered regulatory framework for U.S. defense contractors and subcontractors that was recently introduced by the new Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) 2.0 program;
the EU Network and Information Security Directive (NIS2) which aims to achieve a high common level of cybersecurity within entities providing essential and important services in the EU; and
the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) which is now in effect across the EU financial sector and sets out detailed standards to be enforced by national competent authorities.
Across this evolving legal and regulatory landscape, there is also a notable trend towards management accountability for cyber risk, with DORA (for example) providing for the possibility of direct penalties on management bodies (and therefore, potentially, the individuals within those bodies including company directors).

U.S. SEC enforcement for misleading statements
We have seen the SEC bring an action under the anti-fraud provisions of U.S. securities laws against a company and its CISO relating to a ‘Security Statement’ on the company’s website containing favorable (and in the SEC’s view, misleading) representations about the company’s cybersecurity practices. There has also been criminal liability in the U.S. found against the CISO of another company for misleading the FTC and concealing a historic data breach.

Steps that companies should be taking now
As well as investing in their technical defenses, companies and legal teams can take various steps to enhance their cyber-resilience while meeting legal and regulatory expectations. These include:

Identifying new laws and regulations: increasingly, global organizations have specific personnel (or even teams) who are responsible for identifying and monitoring compliance with new laws and regulations that are coming into force in relevant jurisdictions. In some cases, it is not a straightforward matter to determine whether some or all of an organization is in scope, and an organization may move into or out of the scope of laws or regulations as it changes in size, or its business activities evolve.
Boards and management teams: companies can support their Boards and management teams in various ways. These include the implementation of a cyber sub-committee or working group to oversee cyber risk, board packs containing information that is necessary for effective decision making on cyber risk, as well as skills assessments and training programs.   
Focus on supply chains: as well as taking the steps mandated by law and regulation to address supply chain risk (for example, DORA requires financial entities to include specific contractual provisions in contracts with all ICT service providers and identify all ICT service providers who support critical and important functions), companies should regularly audit their key suppliers’ cybersecurity compliance and develop contingency plans for supply chain incidents. 
Incident response preparedness: regular tabletop exercises simulating a major cyber incident at an operational or strategic level are now a common feature of many companies’ resilience programs. As a major cyber incident is likely to require input and oversight from the company’s legal advisors (both internal and external) it is important that they are in attendance. Incident response plans should also be reviewed and updated regularly.
Regulatory notifications: all organizations, but especially global organizations operating in multiple jurisdictions, need to know the timing, form, and content of their notifications to regulators for incidents meeting the required thresholds.  
Cyber whistleblowing
There is anecdotal evidence that cyber whistleblowing is on the rise, both during and outside of major incidents. In the latter case, the result can be that confidential information relating to an ongoing incident is leaked to the press or investigators, with a consequent risk that incorrect information is disseminated which compromises decision-making processes or results in unnecessary disclosures. Companies and legal teams can do the following to address this issue:

Whistleblowing protocols. Consider implementing communication channels (or adapting existing channels) for individuals who wish to escalate their cyber-related concerns, with protocols for prompt investigation and resolution.
Scenario planning. Build the possibility of information leaks and whistleblowing into incident response planning.
Governance and reporting lines. Confirm who is responsible for reporting issues and whether your CISO has (or should have) direct access to the Board. In some cases, concerns are raised via whistleblowing channels because an individual believes that they will not otherwise be escalated appropriately. ",technical,cybersecurity,
" Areport from Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) has warned that cybercriminals and state-affiliated actors are increasingly leveraging AI for fraud, hacking, and propaganda campaigns. The findings are based on a comprehensive analysis of how threat actors interacted with Google’s AI-powered assistant, Gemini. The research reveals how advanced persistent threat (APT) groups, cybercriminals, and information operations (IO) actors are using AI to automate phishing scams, spread misinformation, and manipulate models to bypass security controls. While AI has not yet introduced breakthrough cyberattack capabilities, threat actors are using it to refine and scale existing tactics.

“Rather than enabling disruptive change, generative AI allows threat actors to move faster and at higher volume,” wrote the GTIG. “For skilled actors, generative AI tools provide a helpful framework, similar to the use of Metasploit or Cobalt Strike in cyber threat activity. For less skilled actors, they also provide a learning and productivity tool, enabling them to more quickly develop tools and incorporate existing techniques.”

Threat actors exploiting AI for cybercrime, espionage, and disinformation
GTIG’s research identifies a rise in the number of cybercriminals exploiting AI for business email compromise (BEC), phishing attacks, and malware development. Underground marketplaces are actively selling jailbroken AI models that bypass security restrictions, enabling automated cybercrime.

Illicit AI tools such as FraudGPT and WormGPT have been promoted in underground forums, offering capabilities that include automated phishing, AI-assisted malware creation, and cybersecurity evasion techniques. GTIG observed that cybercriminals are using AI to craft highly deceptive emails, manipulate digital content, and execute fraud schemes at scale.

The report details how state-backed APT groups are exploring AI to aid cyber espionage and reconnaissance. GTIG’s findings indicate that Iranian, Chinese, North Korean, and Russian APT actors have attempted to use AI to analyze vulnerabilities, assist in malware scripting, and conduct reconnaissance on targets.

However, GTIG found no evidence that AI has fundamentally improved the attack capabilities of these groups. APT actors are primarily using AI for automating research, translating materials, and generating basic code rather than developing novel cyberattack techniques. Attempts to override AI safety mechanisms and generate explicitly malicious content were largely unsuccessful.

The report also examines how IO actors are leveraging AI for propaganda and misinformation. GTIG observed that Iranian and Chinese IO groups used AI to refine messaging, generate politically motivated content, and enhance social media engagement strategies. Russian actors explored AI for automating content creation and increasing the reach of disinformation campaigns.

Some groups experimented with AI-generated videos and synthetic images to create more persuasive narratives. While AI has not yet transformed influence campaigns, threat actors are actively testing its potential to scale and refine disinformation tactics.

To counter the growing misuse of AI, Google has reinforced its AI security measures under the Secure AI Framework (SAIF). The tech giant claimed that it has expanded threat monitoring, adversarial testing, and real-time abuse detection to mitigate risks associated with AI-powered threats.",technical,cybersecurity,
" Why cybersecurity representations and warranties are essential
When acquiring a company — particularly through a stock purchase or merger — a buyer generally inherits not only the target's assets and opportunities but also its liabilities and risks. In asset acquisitions, by contrast, the buyer may have more flexibility in selecting which liabilities to assume, although certain obligations may still carry over depending on applicable law and contractual arrangements.
Cybersecurity breaches and data privacy issues can significantly impact the value of a deal, leading to financial losses, legal liabilities, reputational damage, and operational disruptions. While due diligence aims to uncover vulnerabilities, previous incidents, or outdated systems, it may not reveal all potential cyber risks.
Buyers rely on representations and warranties to determine an appropriate purchase price and to allocate risks effectively. These provisions serve as contractual assurances from the seller about the state of the target company's cybersecurity and data privacy practices. They supplement the due diligence process by:
•Allocating risk: Clearly defining which party bears the responsibility for specific cybersecurity risks.
•Providing legal recourse: Offering the buyer remedies if the actual situation differs materially from what was represented.
•Encouraging disclosure: Motivating the seller to disclose all relevant cybersecurity information during negotiations.
•Acting as a backstop: Protecting the buyer from cybersecurity issues that due diligence may not have uncovered.
Even when a buyer conducts robust due diligence, the seller has more intimate knowledge of the target entity. Therefore, the inclusion of carefully drafted representations and warranties can serve as a critical safety net.

A buyer should consider including the following representations and warranties to mitigate cyber risks effectively. Ideally, to ensure comprehensive protection these provisions should not have significant materiality or knowledge qualifiers.
Compliance with laws and regulations
Representation: The target entity has at all times conducted its business in compliance with applicable privacy and data security laws, which are expressly described in the purchase agreement.
Example: ""The Company is and has been in full compliance with all applicable data protection, privacy, and cybersecurity laws, including but not limited to [list specific laws and regulations].""
Existence and adherence to privacy policies
Representation: The target company has established, implemented, and maintained comprehensive data security and privacy policies in accordance with industry best practices and legal requirements.
Example: ""The Company has adopted and adheres to written data security policies that comply with all applicable laws and accurately reflect its data handling practices.""
No violations of policies or obligations
Representation: The consummation of the M&A transaction will not violate any existing policies, contractual obligations, or applicable privacy laws.
Example: ""Neither the execution nor the performance of this Agreement will result in a violation of any data privacy or security policies, contracts, or legal obligations binding upon the Company.""
Absence of data or security breaches
Representation: The target entity has not been the subject of a data or security breach, including any breach that required reporting to government entities, regulators, or affected individuals.
Example: ""The Company has not experienced any data or security breaches, unauthorized access, or other compromises of its information systems or data that required notification under any applicable law.""
Compliance with designated security standards
Representation: The target company's cybersecurity practices comply with certain designated security standards, frameworks, or practices, or exceed them where appropriate.
Example: ""The Company maintains cybersecurity measures that comply with, or exceed, the requirements of [specific security standards/frameworks, e.g., ISO 27001, NIST Cybersecurity Framework].""
Compliance with contractual data privacy obligations
Representation: The target company complies with all data privacy and security provisions within its contracts with customers, vendors, and partners.
Example: ""The Company is and has been in compliance with all data privacy and security obligations under its agreements with third parties, including customers, suppliers, and service providers.""
Adequacy of security measures
Representation: The target company maintains appropriate and up-to-date security measures, technologies, and safeguards to protect its systems and data.
Example: ""The Company has implemented and maintains commercially reasonable security procedures and practices appropriate to the nature of the information to protect personal data from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure.""
No legal actions or claims
Representation: There are no actions, claims, investigations, or proceedings threatened or pending against the target company concerning its data privacy or cybersecurity practices.
Example: ""There are no current or past claims, investigations, or proceedings by any governmental authority or third party alleging violations of data privacy or cybersecurity laws or regulations.""
Future compliance assurance
Representation: The target company commits to maintaining compliance with data privacy and cybersecurity laws from the date of the agreement until the closing of the transaction.
Example: ""Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date, the Company shall continue to comply with all applicable data privacy and cybersecurity laws and shall not undertake any actions that would cause a breach of the representations and warranties herein.""
Negotiating representations and warranties
Since representations and warranties are ultimately about risk allocation, sellers may attempt to limit their exposure by:
•Introducing knowledge qualifiers: Limiting warranties to matters within the actual knowledge of certain individuals within the company.
•Adding materiality thresholds: Restricting warranties to issues that are materially significant to the value of the transaction.
•Setting look-back periods: Limiting the representations to a specific time frame in the past.
However, buyers should aim to minimize such limitations, especially for cybersecurity matters. Representations and warranties without significant materiality or knowledge qualifiers provide stronger protection, ensuring that the buyer can rely on the seller's assurances.
Impact of due diligence findings on representations and warranties
If due diligence uncovers vulnerabilities, previous incidents, or outdated systems, the buyer should anticipate additional costs to enhance the target's security infrastructure. This may prompt:
•Negotiation of purchase price adjustments: Seeking a lower price to account for the investment needed in cybersecurity improvements.
•Holdback or escrow mechanisms: Setting aside a portion of the purchase price to secure remedies for cyber risks post-closing.
•Specific covenants: Requiring the seller to undertake certain cybersecurity measures before closing.
•Extended survival periods: Implementing longer survival periods for cybersecurity representations and warranties, as deficiencies may not be detected until long after closing.
Moreover, a cyberattack occurring between signing and closing could represent a material adverse change (MAC) in the target's business. Properly drafted representations and warranties, along with MAC clauses, can enable the buyer to reassess the terms of the deal or potentially terminate the agreement.
Conclusion
Considering the significant risks associated with cyberattacks, cybersecurity should be an integral part of every stage in the M&A process. Even the most thorough due diligence may not reveal all potential cyber threats. Therefore, including detailed cybersecurity and data privacy representations and warranties in the purchase agreement is crucial.
These provisions not only allocate risk appropriately but also encourage full disclosure and compliance, ultimately protecting the buyer's investment. Buyers can mitigate the inherent cyber risks in M&A transactions by requesting representations and warranties that cover (1) the existence of and adherence to data security policies, (2) compliance with contractual obligations, (3) absence of unauthorized access and security incidents, and (4) the adequacy of security measures.
In an era where cyber threats are evolving, taking proactive steps through well-crafted representations and warranties is essential for securing the value and success of M&A deals. ",technical,cybersecurity,
" What is Cyber ​​Security?
Cyber ​​security is known as a field of information technology, also known as information security, in which individuals, institutions and systems are protected from digital hacking, unauthorized access or serious security threats that may affect the privacy of data and information, especially sensitive ones, as well as the management of the production process itself, especially since industries of all kinds are now closely linked to technology.

The main goal behind the emergence of cyber security is the emergence of what are known as dangerous digital attacks or immune viruses, in which the digital systems of individuals or the facility are attacked and the sensitive data they possess is controlled, and they are subjected to blackmail and theft operations, as well as deliberate sabotage of information.

As a result of the huge losses caused by these attacks, cyber security has emerged, not only for the purpose of defending or protecting against harmful computer attacks, but also for the purpose of carrying out a deliberate attack in which vulnerabilities in the system are discovered and worked on to fix them immediately upon their discovery.

The field of cybersecurity is usually associated with some of the terms related to each other, such as cybercrime and cyberattacks: in which illegal planning is carried out using digital technology to control a device or system belonging to an individual or institution, using advanced devices or exploiting system vulnerabilities, or depending on the user's ignorance and lack of technological culture.

The importance of cybersecurity
Cybersecurity is important due to the high financial cost allocated to repelling cyberattacks of various types, as the average budget spent to repel attacks is $ 17 million.

There are more than 21.1 billion devices connected to the Internet around the world, which is equivalent to 21.1 billion potential attacks in the world of cyberspace, which in turn is what could happen if it were not for cybersecurity and its vital developments that are occurring in a successive and rapid manner at the present time.

The importance of cybersecurity lies in the fact that it maintains the sensitivity and security of users' private information, especially that which may expose people to danger or the countries in which they reside, because any information that may be marginal or unimportant to some individuals may be the link that a hacker needs to do his job.

Cybersecurity helps countries maintain the confidentiality of their information from being hacked by hostile countries or being exposed to cyber attacks that cause paralysis or scandalous losses to their economy, which in turn can be imagined as a type of modern warfare in our current era.

Cybersecurity also helps develop cloud services technology because the presence of a wall that protects the privacy of the data stored in it makes users more confident in its efficiency and more invested in spending money on it with ease.

Paying attention to the cybersecurity of websites and services helps give service providers an additional competitive advantage, so that users tend to deal with secure websites, especially those that require payment gateways or sharing sensitive data or personal information.

Cybersecurity helps protect users from illegal activities that occur on the dark web, most of which are life-threatening or expose the browser to legal accountability, not to mention the ethical aspect as well.

Therefore, the field of cyber security is linked to four basic concepts: cyber crime, cyber attacks, cyber deterrence, and cyber space. The areas of work vary between:

1. Application security

2. Cloud security

3. Financial security in financial transactions

4. Security in the critical infrastructure of the system

5. Information and data security

6. Network security

7. Operational security

8. End-user security awareness

9. Disaster recovery, especially those related to cyber attacks or natural causes

Types of cyber security

1- Network security:

Most attacks that occur are via electronic networks, so security systems have been put in place that act as a safety valve for the network. These systems ensure immediate solutions and complete control over data elements and access to the network, in order to prevent any attacks that attempt to steal or damage the data stored on their servers.

2- Cloud Security:

Since the prevailing trends now for most organizations around the world are to use artificial intelligence technology and storage clouds, it has become necessary to secure the digital cloud because it contains a huge amount of data for these organizations, and a group of companies specialized in this field provide services to solve this crisis, such as Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure.

3- Application Security:

Web applications are like anything else directly connected to the Internet, so it is logical that they are threatened by attacks on their cybersecurity, and this type of cybersecurity helps companies and organizations discover sensitive data that must be protected from expected attacks, through anti-virus programs, firewalls, and information encryption processes.

4- IoT Security:

Although the use of IoT devices (such as smart devices, AI tools, and sensitive sensors across a single global network) provides many productive benefits, it exposes organizations to cyber threats. IoT security protects them by discovering connected devices and classifying them according to their operational role in addition to the extent of the authority granted to access the database. When any unusual movement is sensed, it controls network activities and monitors any exploitation of these devices at runtime and deals with them.

5- End-user Security:

Endpoint security is a set of features Technology Arsat is used to protect end-user devices from cyber attacks that are caused by malicious and unwanted programs, such as desktop and laptop computers, and mobile phones, which employees use to access company networks and access multiple resources, so organizations seek to protect these devices in order to prevent any external attempt to access networks and databases stored on company servers. 6- Infrastructure Security:

Infrastructure security of organizations is defined as a security measure based on protecting the system's vital infrastructure and reducing vulnerabilities in these systems from corruption, sabotage and terrorism, such as network communications, data center, server or IT center, and an emergency plan is put in place in the event that the company's systems are targeted by cybercriminals. The vital infrastructure includes the following:

1) Power supply and transmission systems

2) Water supply

3) Cooling system

4) Heating and air circulation

7- Disaster recovery related to cyber attacks or natural causes:

Disaster recovery or business continuity in the conditions of recovery from cyber attacks is the process of resuming business after a database is damaged, and depending on the size, scope and business of the company, different plans are set to help employees communicate and continue to perform their jobs in the event of an attack.

8- Information and Data Security:

Information security is the process of designing and deploying tools to protect your business's critical information from destruction, disruption or alteration. It is the critical factor in ensuring cybersecurity. It is specifically designed to maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of business data, and ensure that only authorized applications and systems can access certain information. It also plays a pivotal role in monitoring and investigating potential malicious behavior, trying to contain threats and respond promptly to incidents while preserving evidence for potential prosecution.

9- Financial Security:

Some people think that cybersecurity and data security are not related to the accounting cycle, but due to the threats of hacking the company's financial data, which can include errors and unintentional data breaches, the financial security system was created and innovative solutions were provided in the event that databases were attacked by cybercriminals, and data protection from financial threats and violations that threaten livelihoods, business growth, customer relationships and more.

Cybersecurity Features:
Cybersecurity has a set of features that distinguish it from other fields, the most important of which are:

1- Trust and distrust:

The firewall of the cybersecurity system has something like an electronic filter for the type and nature of programs and technologies that are allowed to be activated, so that it allows the passage of programs that actually have the trust of the user as well as the electronic store and have been confirmed to be safe to use, and prevents malicious programs from intruding or exploiting vulnerabilities.

The philosophy of information security can be translated at this point, as cybersecurity deals with all programs as untrustworthy programs, until they are allowed by the user and their safety is confirmed through their credibility in electronic stores, allowing the passage of what has been confirmed to be safe, and preventing unknown sources from hacking the system.

2- Protection from internal threats:

One of the most important features of cybersecurity is protecting the device from internal threats that may occur due to the user's lack of culture or ignorance of the field of information security, in which he may allow unknown programs to be activated or use tools that affect his personal security or the sensitivity of sharing his information, or one of the tools he uses contains a malicious virus that his system should not contain, then cybersecurity quickly alerts the individual or institution to the danger he faces and prevents this procedure from occurring as soon as possible.

3- Protection from external threats:

The feature of protection from external threats represents the most important feature of cybersecurity, in which a firewall is built capable of filtering out external risks resulting from dealing with the digital world, starting with the risks of dangerous emails or malicious links or viruses or addressing weaknesses in the system or loopholes that a third party may exploit to control and control.

4- Comprehensive vision:

Cybersecurity tools provide their users - individuals or companies - with a comprehensive vision of the strengths and weaknesses of their systems, so that they can identify technological vulnerabilities and work to solve them as quickly as possible, while providing them with suggestions on the ideal way to prevent their recurrence.

5- Continuous monitoring:

Cybersecurity is based on the continuous monitoring feature, as its firewall does not work once or at specific hours, but the system works all the time with the aim of detecting any defect as soon as it exists and working to quickly fix it and prevent it from causing any harm and maintaining the security of information and the security of the user for the longest possible period.

6- Compliance with policies and laws:

The goal of cybersecurity is primarily to maintain the confidentiality and privacy of data and information, in addition to combating harmful viruses of all kinds. In order to achieve this goal effectively, the powers granted to professionals should not be exploited in order to penetrate the base on which it was originally created.

Therefore, compliance with laws and legislative policies related to information security is one of the most important characteristics of cybersecurity, as external sources are not allowed to view the sensitive information and data that is shared, or misuse it in any possible way. These laws vary according to the type and nature of the field in which cybersecurity is applied.

7- Diversity:

The cybersecurity system must have integrated solutions related to Dealing with cyber threats, so that the system is not activated to protect against a certain type of threat and allow another, but rather it must analyze, detect, deal with and prevent all possible types of attacks that pose a threat to the safety and security of information.

What is meant by a cyber attack?
A cyber attack is one of the latest types of digital dangers facing humans at the present time, in which a person, entity, institution or even a state is exposed to electronic attacks with the aim of disrupting, destroying or unauthorized access to valuable or sensitive data for the entity or party that is being attacked.

Cyber ​​attacks may occur to individuals not because of the value of the data or information they possess, but because they are a link between other valuable parties that are difficult to reach, or because they have the authority to access devices and technologies that are difficult to hack directly, which is the same thing that happened to a university clinic in Germany when its system was completely hacked due to a technological loophole in one of its devices used.

Types of Threats in Cybersecurity

After getting to know both the concept and characteristics of cybersecurity, it is now time to shed light on the most famous types of threats in it, which represent the biggest scourge that the digital world deals with, and which often cause huge losses that are difficult to deal with. The role of cybersecurity here is not only to defend against its attacks, but to prevent them from happening in the first place as follows:

1- Malware:

Malware is advanced viruses that are designed to circumvent the protection systems installed on the system and work to cause damage or malfunction in it, which allows manipulation or control of sensitive data based primarily on the vulnerabilities that can be exploited.

2- Ransomware:

Ransomware is one of the most dangerous cyber attacks in our current digital world, according to recent global statistics, there is a ransomware attack approximately every 10 seconds at least, in which all the victim's data is blocked and encrypted, and he is not allowed to access it except after paying a large financial ransom, and the more confidential and sensitive this data is, the more the owners of these viruses exploit the matter and impose major impossible orders, which the victim has no choice but to submit to in the end.

3- Phishing:

In this case, the victim's lack of electronic culture or lack of attention to the information displayed to him is exploited, and he is made to willingly share sensitive information related to his credit card or confidential information that should not be shared with the public, such as the password for logging into digital platforms or other sites. The percentage of cyber attacks related to phishing operations for information is 80% of the percentage of attacks carried out on individuals and institutions, and according to Google, more than 2.1 million sites were estimated to be dedicated to this in 2020 alone.

4- Exploiting binary programs or what is known as the middleman attack:

The middleman attack is one of the common tools used in cyber attacks, in which the attacker exploits the victim's resort to a second, weakly protected technical source, and enters the system through it, such as exploiting the Wi-Fi network and working to hack the system of the devices shared in it and working to install malicious programs that help control it.

5- Direct phishing or what is known as spear phishing:

In this, an individual or an institution is targeted, and all its defense and protection systems are studied in detail, then work is done to discover the loopholes contained in the system and the mechanism for exploiting them for the benefit of a systematic penetration and control process.

6- Long-term advanced sequencing:

In this, the protection systems are penetrated in a hidden and gradual manner, such that it is not discovered until after a long period of time, during which the damage has already been done and the system has been completely controlled successfully.

7- Denial of service attacks:

In this, the system is bombarded with a barrage of traffic, messages and fake users, so that a kind of pressure is created on the servers and they are disabled or slowed down, which causes huge losses, especially if this attack is at a special time when the company expects to achieve large gains from the influx of visitors, especially during seasons or discounts or after announcing strong competitive offers.

Cybercrime
Cybercrime is basically based on a set of organized attacks in which the victim's digital system is manipulated and completely controlled in what is known as cyber attacks. In order to protect the victim from these attacks, what is known as a cyber shield must be put in place.

A cyber shield is known as an effective firewall that is activated on the digital system, with the aim of quickly discovering any loophole that could provide an opportunity for a dangerous cyber attack, so that the person or institution can ultimately browse the digital world freely without fear of their information being exploited or spied on, which is known as freedom of movement in cyberspace.",technical,cybersecurity,
